"Two problems:

It just smells. I have to leave it in the garage for 2 weeks before it becomes tolerable. Suggestion to all (Chinese) furniture makers: why not air it out before putting in the package? Between a pre-aired vs. a smelly brand-new, I'd pick the former without a doubt.

Bigger problem: at its highest, it's still quite low to sit on. Not high enough for my daughter. (21 inches) I guess I will wait for my daughter to grow faster then :)

Too bad it's so heavy. I'd hate to pay shipping cost again. Oh well.",2.0

"Tremendous value for the money. These sound phenomenal - full and crisp and plenty loud enough. I bought these to replace a pair of Advent AV570s, one of which was irreparably damaged. While discontinued now, the Advents originally sold for near the same price. The Mackie MK3 pair absolutely blows the Advents clean out of the water. No contest.",5.0
"Bought these at GC when the salesman there was pushing them as the best new thing.  To install and use, they're pretty similar to Dunlop dual-design strap locks, fairly straightforward.  Gigged with them a couple of time since then and they seem pretty solid.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks.  First, with a lot of other straplocks out there (like Dunlop or Schaller) there is still a fairly traditional strap button in place even when you remove the lock.  In other words, if for whatever reason you wanted to switch out a strap or if you were to lose the locks, you still have a button to attach a strap to.  The Loxx design only has a very small pin which could never serve as a strap button by itself.  I suppose they did it this way because some people think traditional strap locks stick out too much from the body, but personally I prefer the fall back.  The other thing is that it seems nearly impossible to get the lock off a strap once you've put it on.  If you get a new strap or (in my case) decide to sell the instrument the locks are on, have fun removing it.

Otherwise, these are pretty good and seem to do the job they were designed for.",3.0
Not the best quality on the supplies. The cork itself is not a good quality and is not good for applying it on saxophone neck. The sandpaper is way too coarse. Overall a two star product but it comes with everything you need.,2.0
"The size was great. It came on time. But unfortunately the guitar would NOT stay in tune at all. Not even after playing a few chords. I'm gonna have to purchase a guitar at a store in person to try it out etc...But not a problem with company, just need better more quality instrument. :-)",2.0

"I am a violinist and knew better, but did it anyway because it was super cheap and I figured what the hey.  Bow came loose in a tube and was warped upon arrival.  Tightens fine and rosins up ok, but sounds sort of dead on the strings.  I'm donating it to an elementary school beginning student for which it should serve it's purpose well enough.",2.0

"I now have about 10 of these cables, I love the fact it's so hard to tangle these (short of tying a knot in it) I never have trouble with the end unscrewing itself because they have some heat shrink over it. Also very well insulated! I recommend these to all my friends an fellow musicians!",5.0
Great unit.. Spectacular sound..! Connects to Bluetooth and the sound comes pouring out..! Great buy.!,5.0
"Works just as we'd hoped! We used the drywall anchors it came with and no problems whatsoever. Been hanging our Acoustic guitar for a few months now and we love it so much that we have ordered a second for our new electric guitar. Keeps our guitars safe and out of the way when not in use while making our wall beautiful!

"The EQ works electrochemically pretty good for the money its a good value to the dollar. However there is one MAJOR issue, the rack mount hardware. If you are not going to rack mount this EQ you can quite reading this review any further. If you going to rack mount the unit, you will have the following three issues in doing so.

1) The six screws which are used to mount the two side rack ears to the EQ are not included. You will need to supply your own six countersunk self=tapping metal sheet screws.

2) The holes for the rack ears is one-mount thread off. You can rack the unit OK, however you will have a half inch gap between the EQ and the next item in your rack. The four front mounting holes are in the wrong place on the rack ears.

3) The four rack ears to rack mounting screws are not included.

Because of this rack hardware issue, I only gave a 3 star rating.",3.0
"There good for the price. Ive had them for about 5 months now and 1 of them broke pretty recently. For the price and for a pack of 3 definitely recommend it. As for the sound, I use this as a mic for when i play games with my friends, or any online server. The sound quality is good and works for everyday normal use. Sound is pretty clear and can pick up everything im saying. Only thing i dislike is the quality but like i stated before for the price you cant beat that.",4.0

"This is a stiff styrofoam molded case with a not-so-fabulous exterior nylon skin. The molded interior is uncushioned but covered with a soft velvety material and the storage compartment is very roomy indeed. Nothing screams 'cheapness' like velvet covered styrofoam. While my Martin koa tenor fits perfectly, the problem is that it will provide little protection when on the go. There is no neck strap to hold the uke immobile and there is no cushioning under the case top to sandwich it in place either. So, when fully zipped up and rotated horizontally, the instrument bounces around inside. That's not even borderline acceptable, which I would have been happy with at this price. I like the Lanikai soft case I have for my concert uke but I frankly don't want to live with the goofy artwork they use this time around. I'm going to listen to that inner voice I ignored before and go with the Pro Tec MAX case that is so well reviewed.",2.0

"I bought this mic to use with my Canon T2i. It does sound a little better than the built in mic but just barely!
BUT the output is about 30% lower than the built in mic and worse, there is a fairly loud background hiss all the time!

Big sound from a relatively short but easy to handle instrument.  Unfortunately it has cracked.  There are no care instructions included that I recall.  Perhaps the moisture should be monitored to keep this from happening?,4.0
These are outstanding.  I have been playing them for 5 years.  I rehearse and practice about 12 hours a week.  2 reeds get me about 3 to 4 months before they need to be replaced.  With cane I would go through about 16 to 20 reeds in that time.  Great sound and a better bang for the buck.,5.0
I researched this capo A LOT before purchase. Ive read many reviews elsewhere and all of the reviews here. I went ahead and purchased this capo and its brilliant. It functions exactly as it is designed to and has opened up a whole new world of creativity. For the life of me a cant figure out how others can manage or claim that this device damaged anything other than their ego. It is made out of a polymer like plastic. Where it clamps on the guitar neck is padded. If clamped correctly and in the correct area (as per included instructions) it performs flawlessly. Ive placed it on my Taylor 6 and my Taylor baritone 8. Fully adjustable and fits both perfectly with no buzzing or throwing out of pitch no matter where its placed on the neck. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.,5.0

"The TRX is a great mixer with options that you don't even find on the Rane TTM56S. XLR outs, scratch able filter effects and dedicated DVS ins and outs (which allow seamless switching between vinyl and control) to name a few. The faders are great (mini-innofaders). Curve control on all and an extra set of fader caps come with the mixer, not to mention the box it comes in is one of the hottest I've seen.

A negative is there are no send or returns for post fader effects.",5.0
As described. Works great!,5.0
"First, I just want to say that I am a full-time acoustic musician in Oklahoma. I play about 150 gigs a year and change my strings every 3 or 4 gigs. I play on a Gibson Songwriter Deluxe Studio Acoustic and my gigs range from 3-5 hours. So... I change my strings about 50 times a year. It may seem expensive to you now, but... If you play as much as I do, you would want to stop breaking strings halfway through your second set.

I play on medium strings and I don't buy anything other than Elixirs. Why? Because they are quality strings. I had to play on a set of Martin strings for a couple gigs and I experienced extreme finger fatigue when I was playing on those. It made me miss my Elixir strings almost instantly and I never want to play on any other kind of string.

You cannot go wrong with these strings. I have a set of Elixirs on a guitar I don't gig with at home, but play on quite frequently, and they haven't lost their sound or smoothness after several months. I love my Elixirs. Loyal fan - tested and true.",5.0

"I really like this little headphone amp. It has great sound, a few different effects and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. When I was looking around I was trying to find a portable with a little built in speaker. This does NOT have a speaker. Headphone use. It does have an aux on it which is fairly neat. The batteries it came with actually worked fine for me. All in all this isn't what I was looking for originally but I am so impressed I'm going to keep it and use it. I have a set of portable speakers for my psp that this plugs into just fine and is actually fairly loud. So I would give this a ""GREAT BUY"" title.",5.0

Best guitar capo. Ever.,5.0
Just helped my daughter install this on her harp. Fairly easy to install. Not much documentation but there was a useful diagram for placement. Can't complain about the sound for the price. We'll try it with different pre-amps and amplifiers but out of the box we got enough of a signal to test for balance and trigger midi guitar through an iPhone. Since she'll mostly be using it for adding a bit of volume and some effects this kit more than meets her needs and probably will encourage a lot more practice. The clip for the quarter inch jack seems a bit flimsy to hold up to long term use. Time will tell.,4.0

"I have a few Shure SM58s which cost more.  I like the open sound of the PG48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the SM58s.  I like this mic ok but the SM58 is worth the extra money I think, especially if you expect to push its capability.",4.0

"I like the pedal a lot. And I'm not going to launch into a dumb dialogue about the plastic casing like so many people here do when they're reviewing a Behringer pedal. Only an unprofessional kid trying to show off would take the ""stomp"" part literally and actually jump on them. The housing is well built. I have several Behringer pedals all of which I like and enjoy quite a bit. This one is no different however I have not had that much time to sit and dive real deep into it. Obviously digital delay pedals require a little more attention than the analogs. But so far it has lived up to its reputation and is preforming as it should. So if you're looking for a solid digital delay for an unbelievable price you cannot go wrong here! The 4 stars is only because I have not had the pedal that long. I have no doubt that in time it will get the 5th star like all of my others have!",4.0

"Purchased for my smallish 7yo daughter.  Good size for her to learn on.  Guitar has a solid spruce soundboard, which is amazing to find on such a low priced instrument.  The tuning machines are easy to use and do the job they're supposed to.  The guitar stays in tune pretty well and has a good even tone for a small instrument (that solid spruce soundboard again).  Strings sound ok, one of them (the 4th string) popped soon after purchase but at $0.80 to replace it's not a big problem.",4.0
"SH-PG bridge pick up replaced one of the 2 Gibson '57 classics in my 2011 SG.  Sounds great stand alone, added just enough edge to get a little dirtier and has noticeably more harmonics.

"These strings are an excellent value.
I bought some beater classical guitar off craigslist to get me through a few months of lessons at school. However, once these strings stretched out I was SHOCKED at the deep richness of the tone. I don't have much to compare to, but a musical enthusiast I can offer a hearty recommendation with this product.

Some of it could be the age of the wood, but I think I can certainly give a big nod to D'Addario for making such a superior product for beginner-intermediate guitarists.

Thanks D'Addario!",5.0

"I purchased these directly from the manufacturer, not via amazon. I purchased them to repair, rather than replace two original new work wall outlet boxes. One of the boxes was beige, not the standard blue, which is not unusual on homes more than 20 years old. Unfortunately, the G-clip screw holes would not line up even if forced down with a screw driver as they instruct you to do. I ended up replacing that box altogether. The second box was the standard blue box most are accustomed to and both screw holes were stripped so I had to use two clips. I was able to install the clips and replace the outlet with a tamper proof outlet per NFPA NEC. Piece of cake. Here I was naive enough to think I was done and it was an easy fix. After three weeks of inserting and removing plugs, the top clip has completely failed and popped off. Im not going to waste the time reinstalling another one. Im just going to replace the box and save myself the time and headache.  Dont say you weren't warned.",1.0

"This is a very extensive review, but I am so pleased with the tone from my upgraded speaker, I wanted to share my experience with everyone, especially those guitar players who are on a budget and can't afford the high priced equipment. After much research on the internet, I chose the Eminence Red Coat series Ramrod 10 inch guitar speaker as an upgrade to the stock speaker in my recently acquired (used) Fender Frontman 25R guitar amplifier. Some comments on various guitar oriented web sites advised against upgrading an inexpensive solid-state guitar amp, recommending that you should save up and buy a ""better,"" more expensive amp rather than waste money on a cheapie. WRONG! Personally, I liked the classic ""Fender"" clean sound of the Frontman and it came equipped with a true spring reverb and two channels, one ""clean"" and one for gain/distortion. One of the most common criticisms of this (and many other solid state amps) is that the distortion channel sounded harsh and ""artificial"" as opposed to the warm, more ""musical"" distortion of a true tube amp. With the stock speaker that's a pretty valid criticism and some 25R owners acknowledged this and said they love the amp mainly for its clean tones, but with the Ramrod installed, the gain/distortion channel really comes into its own. More on tone below.

Unboxing the Ramrod and comparing it to the stock speaker, you can see that the Ramrod has a much larger magnet, and is very solidly built. The Ramrod spec sheet says it weighs 6.4 pounds and has a 30 ounce magnet (I wish I would have weighed it before I installed it, but I didn't think of that at the time). The stock speaker weighs just over 2-1/2  pounds on my postage scale! This speaker swap will make your 25R a few pounds heavier, but the tone improvement is well worth it, and its not a very heavy amp to start with. My research on the Ramrod indicates that the speaker cone is ribbed, and is made in England for Eminence (Eminence is an American company) while the rest of the speaker parts are made and assembled in America. Apparently the ribbed cone is at least partly responsible for what they call the ""British"" tone.

Changing the speaker was a very simple procedure on the 25R: Remove two long Philips head wood screws on either side of the amplifier cabinet and press the speaker magnet from behind. The silver cloth-covered face board of the amp will tilt forward and can be lifted out of a slot in the bottom panel of the amp. Before you lift the face panel out, unplug the two speaker wires from the bayonet connectors on the back of the stock speaker (on my amp, the connectors were plugged fairly tight, but they did come off with a little wiggle and a firm pull). On my amp, the white wire is positive and the black wire is negative/ground (this is normal color coding for many amps & other equipment). Both speakers have a + and - symbol on the fitting that the wires plug into.  The speaker is held to the face panel by four nuts around the perimeter of the speaker (you can see these through the open back of the cabinet before you start disassembly). Take the nuts off and the speaker lifts off of the mounting bolts. The new speaker has perimeter mounting holes that line up with the mounting bolts. Make sure you orient the speaker so that the bayonet clips for attaching the speaker wires are oriented in the same position as the original speaker, then bolt it into place. Tighten the bolts firmly, but don't go too tight or the mounting bolts could strip or come loose from the face panel. Place the assembled speaker/face panel in the cabinet bottom groove, attach the speaker wires to the correct respective positive and negative bayonet clips, and pivot the top of the face panel into the cabinet. Replace the two long wood screws into either side of the amp cabinet. Screw them in firmly but remember they are wood screws going into soft wood (maybe even particle board) so don't go past ""firm"" to ""stripped!"" The process will be similar for many other amps, the variable being how to open up the cabinet. Some amps will require removal of the speaker through the back. To me, the nice thing about speaker replacement is that ordinarily no soldering or special equipment is required.

Tone: Eminence makes several different 10 inch speakers for guitar amplifiers and they have an excellent web site that includes a page they call the ""Tone Guide."" This page has a collection of sound demos for most of the guitar speakers they sell, so you can listen to the different speakers they offer in comparison to each other. They also include a description of the characteristics of each speaker. While these descriptions are highly subjective, I think they are a good indication of the relative merits of the sound qualities of each speaker. Eminence divides their speakers into categories under the names ""Patriot Series"" (having a classic American - read ""Fender"" sound) and ""Red Coat Series"" (having a classic British sound as in ""British invasion"" groups like the Kinks, the Rolling Stones and the Who). Based on reviews and recommendations from online enthusiast sites and Amazon, I narrowed my choices to the Patriot Series ""Copperhead"" and ""Ragin Cajun"" speakers and the Red Coat Series ""Ramrod."" I then went to the Eminence Tone Guide descriptions and sound demos and ultimately chose the Ramrod over the Ragin Cajun because of its warmer midrange and slightly better sounding (to me) demos, but it was a very close decision, and I am confident any of the speakers in question would have made a big improvement over the stock speaker. Give the demos a listen and choose for yourself. Easily noticeable improvements over the stock speaker are: a) its LOUDER!, b) the clean channel sounds better, the Fender Telecaster I play is known for its ""twang"" especially from the bridge pickup, and high notes can sound rather harsh, but the Ramrod delivers high end notes that are smooth and bright without being harsh, c) the gain/distortion channel now sounds GREAT in my opinion, and after hearing it for myself, I understand what Eminence and others are talking about when they describe ""Classic British"" tone. The tones I can now get from the Gain channel are reminiscent of early Kinks (You Really Got Me) and even Rolling Stones (much closer to the authentic ""Satisfaction"" riff than the stock speaker could produce). Sure, you could get better tones from a real Marshall tube amp, but that could cost over ten times what my used Frontman with a speaker upgrade did (less than $150).

I highly recommend the Ramrod as a ten inch replacement/upgrade for modest guitar amplifiers. This is the second amp I have done a speaker upgrade to. After similar research, I put an Eminence Cannabis Rex in my fender Blues Junior and it was also a great improvement, to what I thought was an excellent amp to start with. FYI, I am a self taught guitar enthusiast of limited ability, but I am inspired by the improvement in this, my main practice amp. I've only had the upgraded rig for less than a week, and I'm playing every day because I love the sound of it.

I almost forgot to mention the cool guitar picks that were included in the box with my new speaker (along with an ""Eminence inside"" badge for the amp, which is nice but I probably won't use...). I received two guitar picks with a full color Union Jack on one side and an eminence label and ""RED COAT, pick your sound"" on the other. Very cool, and my favorite guitar picks when I play my Ramrod equipped amp!",5.0

"I purchased this keyboard for my six year old son who is a Suzuki piano student of almost two years now. Although we have a piano (an antique), he showed interest in playing keyboard as well. Having owned a Korg in the past, I was partial to Korg, but we tested several Korgs, Casios, and Yamahas to compare. This WK3200AD was a definite winner with us. Although the comparable Yamaha and Korg had a bit more volume (greater speaker wattage), this Casio had them beat with its sound quality, numerous tones, accompaniment, and effects. The 76 keys allow for one to perform Classical pieces, which is a big plus in our house. Although my son is too young for the MIDI, mixer function, and drawboard, I am sure this keyboard will still be with him when he is older. Fantastic buy!",5.0

"Line 6 Micro Spider Amp:  A detailed review

First, I am far more impressed with the sound than I expected from a 6"", 6 watt amp.  That said, it has a couple of significant flaws.

PROS:
* Decent sound through the main speaker.
* Reasonably loud voice... although I have topped it out and could have used more volume-- and I was doing solo in a small room. It's definitely a ""practice amp"".
* It's $99 on Amazon. Amazingly low price for such versatility.
* You can find and program almost any voice you want, from beautifully mellow classical to hard-metal.  It's very versatile.
* Portable (allows 6 C batteries)
* Separate microphone and guitar amps... perfect for busking
* MP3 input
* You can sing, play an instrument and have Mp3 accompaniment all at the same time.
* Headphone output (see ""Cons"")
* Heavy-duty AC adapter included
* Built-in LED tuner, easily visible, easy to use
* Five programmable digital settings
... and a bunch more.  You can read the specs anywhere

CONS:
* Biggest flaw:  there is a *constant* hiss when using the ""REC OUT / Headphones"" jack.  I've checked out three of these amps and that very audible hiss was present in all three.  This makes it useless for studio recording or even personal computer recording, as the loud hiss would transfer directly to the recording track.  That constant hiss is not nearly as audible in the main speaker-- which says to me ""output jack design flaw"" at the factory level. (Note:  this is definitely an amp hiss and not caused by an ungrounded guitar, power line or other external issues.)
* Aside from the constant hiss in the REC OUT jack... there is audible speaker buzz with many of the settings, especially those that use the gain-type switch. At this stage of the tech game, companies should be eliminating internal hiss and buzz.
* This is not a ""What you see is what you get"" amp like the Roland MicroCube or Peavey Vypyr.  This is a programmable amp and there are no LEDs to indicate the actual settings.  Visually the knobs may be quite different from the settings coming through the amp-- which makes it difficult to track and repeat programmed settings. The knob settings and what the amp is really set to can be totally different.
* Mine came with a manual in every language but English.  I had to go online to get the English manual.
* Controls can be very confusing until manual is read... then it's simple.
* In my opinion the only real benefit of this amp is battery-powered portability. A standard amp accompanied by a $40 digital effects box added can do far more sound-wise.
* For 99 bucks, a 6.5"" speaker is good enough, but Peavey and Fender in this range are both 8"".
* I compared this to a cheap Crate amp I had sitting gathering dust.  The Crate was far better, smoother, more satisfying... and it's just a basic amp.  If the Crate could be run by batteries... it would be great.  Line needs to step up their game on this amp and eliminate these widely-recognized flaws.

Of course, one could argue ""What do you expect from a $99 amp?""  The answer is simple:  clear, accurate sound.  I'd forgo the special effects for an amp that has hiss-free, recordable sound.  I can add my own effects box, but I can't de-buzz bad output.

WHO WANTS IT?
* This is a personal, portable, practice amp.  It's not for band gigs.

* This is a good busking amp (street-corner singing).  It is battery-powered, loud enough to do the job, handles both voice and guitar at the same time with different mixing channels, can have MP3 or external sound source (such as a looper) added to it and it works.  It can be slung over your shoulder using a standard guitar strap.  (It has strap holders on both sides.)

* It's great for personal practice, group practice indoors, smaller presentations.  For weddings, family get-togethers etc, this may work.

* This blows away micro-amps such as the HoneyTone and far out-performs the popular Pignose 7-100.  Of course, it's more expensive than either of those.

OVERALL IMPRESSION
I tested this on a standard electric guitar, a 4-string CBG dual-piezo based, two different mag-based CBGs, and an active-pickup nylon-string classical guitar.  I was able to achieve the sound I wanted from all instruments, ranging from hard rock to back-porch folk to beautifully haunting classical.  It took a bit to find the exact setting for each sound (such things take time), but I was able to find those settings... and the amp was able to produce them.  However in all instances, the overall tone was ""small speaker"" due to the 6.5"" rather than 8"".

I am severely disappointed in the hiss in the REC OUT jack; makes this useless for direct-line recording.  Because of that alone I had to return my unit.  Still, I think some people will be pleased with this.  If you're not busking you may wish to look at other amps with cleaner output.  If you're using it to record into a computer or sound system, you'll definitely want a different amp.",3.0

"With good sound and great looks, this should be one of the best available at a fairly low price.  The neck is just a bit thicker than I like, but I can live with that.
But the guitar came with the bridge setting way too high, so playing high on the neck was not a joy.  I'll be correcting that pretty soon.  And a set of light gauge Elixirs would have started this model off right - and bright.
It's too bad a manufacturer can't see how an extra $10 in the prep process would change the playing experience dramatically.  I can easily make these adjustments, but a new player wouldn't necessarily know to do them.
Plugged in, aside from the high action, this guitar sounded awesome.
And because of the cost, appearance, sound, and ease of correction, I would defiinitely buy this one again.",4.0

"If you need a great looking light but you don't want to break the bank, get the Chauvet LX5 LED(I got TWO!!!).  You will not be disappointed by it's performance!  For DJ's the Chauvet LX5 proves to be an excellent road light with enough muscle to get the party started!

PROS:
- Built like a pro: all metal construction, great bracket, will survive any gig you throw at it!
- Great lighting effects: The LED array is quite impressive, giving a good show
- It's LED!: being LED means NO CYCLE DUTIES!  I left it on for 4 hrs. and no heat whatsoever!
- Lightweight: coming in at around 6 lbs. you can gang several (up to 50) on a single girder!
- Auto program:  doesn't matter what the volume is, it will perform on its own if desired

CONS:
- It's LED!: the LX5 is bright, but don't expect it to perform like a halogen.
- No DMX: if you like to program your lighting effects, this one is not for you
- Single spot: no rotating mirrors so it's not a great single light; you need at least two

The Chauvet LX5 performs great in small to medium gigs.  I think it's a great light and paired up it definitely gives you a great lightshow for very little cost.  If you want a great light, no cycle time, and something way better than a few spots, get the Chauvet LX5 (Amazon dealers have THE BEST PRICE!!! $39.99 if you look) for you gig or house party!

The only problem I ran in to was I couldn't keep it in tune at first,  then realized,  the scale length on a les Paul is only 24.75 whereas the Wolfgang or strat neck is 25.5, which is what the d tuna is designed for. I contacted the company and they had me send it to them so they could shave it down a couple thousandths of an inch, no charge. Works perfect now. Highly recommended it to any whammy freaks.",5.0

"I bought my Blueridge just a few weeks ago. I was looking for a small-bodied guitar with a 'big' sound. I tried out
several Taylors and  Martins with a similar body size that were close in price range to the 371, but hands down, the
Blueridge won me over. For one thing, the bass strings have an incredible resonance. While you may not get as much from
the treble strings, overall, this guitar represents a a wonderful playing experience, whether you are finger picking, strumming, or playing for a heavier rhyhtmic output.

I love the small body size of the guitar, but again, don't be fooled that this parlor model will lack depth or that it doesn't have great tonal output because it does.

I did make several changes though to the guitar: I put some lighter Elixir strings on and sanded the bridge, just a bit to improve playability. The slightly lower action on the guitar made it a bit easier to play. My only complaint is that barring chords can be more of a challenge beyond the fifth fret, but that may vary from player to player, depending on how much you play.

All in all though, for the price, you get a really fine guitar with great sound, and generally good playability.",4.0
"I have had this cello-shaped object for a few days, and have initiated a return already.  Because of shipping I had to take the cello-shaped object to a luthier (he is luthier to the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra) to have the sound post set, but had him  setup the whole thing while I was there (soundpost, bridge, strings, tuning).  Now, let me just say I knew I was getting a cheap instrument - that should be expected by anyone considering this product (confirmed by all the reviews).  On the offset it seems to be pretty solid, but that is certainly not the case.  While the cello-shaped object can produce a decent quality sound for the price, the limitations of the instrument and the poor quality of its materials are quite apparent after an hour or so.  While you could easily get by playing this for a short period, you will be disappointed in the long run.  My luthier said I bought $200 firewood.

Cons:

- the ""crack-proof spruce"" top is VERY soft. My luthier said he had to gingerly twist the pegs when tuning because he could hear the wood creaking under pressure, sounding like it was going to crack/snap at any point. Seeing how you have to tune the cello every time you play, a hard wood (like ebony which is found in almost every other cello including the higher range Cecilios) is necessary for the top for tuning purposes.

- the bridge is too tall - it elevates the strings to a level too far from the fingerboard requiring you to either severely kill your fingers trying by pressing very hard on the string. I would have to have the bridge shaved down to get it to the correct size.

- the strings are very poor quality. The A and D strings produce a tinny, metallic sound, and the A string specifically doesn't resonate correctly; it causes my dog to howl (and he has never done so). The C string at times produces a two tone sound, as if there are two different notes being played. At first I thought it was my novice level playing, but a veteran cellist had the same experience and couldn't figure out why it made that sound.

Pros:

- It really does produce a rich, surprisingly deep sound when it is working properly.

- It's cheap

I am returning this item, and have already put in my order for a rental from Music and Arts.  I highly recommend this option because 1) it's a good way to get a cell into your hand with the support of an established company, 2) you receive a much higher quality instrument, and 3) all rental payments can be put towards the purchase of a cello when you decide to do so.",2.0
"I used this on a country gig last night for the first time! I set the all knobs to 1 O'clock lol and hoped for the best. It sounded great!

"This is a fun banjo/guitar.  It plays nicely.  Projects nicely too.  You can modify it with a pickup with relative ease.  I play guitar and had no interest in learning a new fingering technique for a banjo.  You can play it like a regular guitar, but it projects loudly enough that you can play it just by rubbing your fingers against the strings to get a sound.  It's a nice breather when I'm burnt out on guitar.  It's a different sound.  It's comforting and relaxing.

The question that I think a lot of people who are considering this banjo is ""Do I have to buy the hardshell case Dean makes for it.""
- The answer is ""NO"".

I took a chance and purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrion-C-2901-Fretted-Resonator-Banjo-Case/dp/B001FB5Z4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrion C-2901 Fretted Resonator Banjo Case</a>&nbsp;(sold here on Amazon) and it fits my Dean Backwoods 6 Banjo perfectly.  It's also about $20 cheaper than the Dean banjo case.  It looks great too.

On a side note, a standard acoustic guitar gig bag will also hold the guitar, but the finish on this is so nice, I really wanted to protect it with a hardshell case.

UPDATE: After a few weeks of playing this, my finger-picking technique has improved tremendously.  The Backwoods is so resonant and has such a nice projection that even very subtle moves remain audible.  I don't consider myself to be a skilled guitarist, but I sound better than ever when playing this - I liken it to how sub-par singers will sometimes use a lot of reverb on their vocals to cover up imperfections.  I can play softer and with more precision, but still remain audible.  It's been a great guitar to practice with and it's shaken up my sometimes monotonous practice routine.",5.0
"Good sticks, I always use Vater and tried changing to the Xtreme Design for the extended length and width. The sticks hit hard and fit my hands better than 5b's do.

I have been playing for 40 plus years and decided to get a horn to beat around with.  This is a very low quality instrument.  The slide was never finished properly and had several areas of missing plating which caused the slide to drag terribly.

The slide action on a trombone is everything.,1.0
"I am a beginner adult piano student so I am writing my review from this viewpoint.  I have an acoustic piano, but needed a keyboard (with headphones) to practice on so that I could stop disturbing my family when practicing my lessons.  I like some things about the keyboard, but there are other things I don't, so I have decided to return it.

What I like about the NP32:
*It has a beautiful piano sound.
*It's lightweight/portable.
*It's nice looking.
*It's simple. It has a metronome, recorder and a few voices.  I wasn't looking for 300+ voices and onboard lessons that I would never use, so the NP32 delivers in that area.
*I like that when I press the keys harder or lighter, the sound gets louder or softer.

These are all pluses.

What I didn't like:
* I would perfect a song on the NP32, but could not replay the same song without a ton of errors on my acoustic. I think this is because the NP32's keys are more narrow (than an acoustic).  Smaller keys may not be an issue for other beginners or for more experienced players, but for me, it's a deal breaker.
*Secondly, the volume is not loud enough for my taste, even with headphones in.  And from what I can see there is no way to attach external speakers.  Even if there were a way doing so would take away from the portability and sleek look of the keyboard.

For these reasons I'm returning it.

Who is this keyboard for?
*For someone who can play this board and have it not affect their play on an acoustic.
*For someone who needs a battery operated keyboard that's simple, portable and has a wonderful piano sound.
*This keyboard is also for someone who can tolerate 12 watts of speaker power and have it be okay.
If you decide to purchase this keyboard be sure to use the PA-150 power adapter.

I ordered this keyboard based on reading all the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and by watching tons of YouTube videos. I swore I would love it. I didn't. I'm happy I ordered it because now I know how important key width and speaker wattage are to me and I know what to look for moving forward.

If/when I find a keyboard that suits my needs, I will be sure to update this post. Happy shopping everyone.",3.0

"Not quite as bright as new strings usually are, but definitely warm sounding. Less string squeak is nice. The thing I couldn't get over, unfortunately, was the weird feeling of the bass strings to my right thumb. I usually don't use picks. As smooth as these strings are to go up and down the fretboard with my left hand, the right hand just didn't like them at all- the bass strings seemed to have some weird styrofoamy feeling friction against my thumb and it sorta slows my right hand down, throwing me off my attack, and just feels icky. For slide playing, they are quite nice. And if you use fingerpicks or flatpicks, they should be just fine.",3.0

"The reeds play great straight out of the box. They have a deep, rich tone. I play Vandoren's on alto but stick with these on tenor. It just seems to go with the deep, rich feel of the tenor I suppose...

Icing on the cake is the fact that the reeds are packaged in individual plastic cases that I love--the reeds slip in vertically (instead of horizontally like with many other little plastic covers) and the packages have these little ramps that hold the reed in place. They almost feel like mini reed protectors.

Some people in their reviews mention that the reeds seem thin and breakable, but I don't get that feel from them. I even sometimes accidentally snag the reed on something and am sure there will be a chip, but I look down to see that the reed is completely undamaged. Perhaps the real test of their durability is the fact that my 9 yo (who is learning to play the saxophone) hasn't managed to chip it either.",5.0

"First Impressions of the Blue enCORE 300 I received an  as a gift and used for the first time at band practice last night.

BACKGROUND: I sing lead in a 10 piece band which includes a 4 piece horn section. We practice in a small room (approx. 12 by 18 feet) and it gets really loud, especially when the horns are playing something they like (Chicago and Tower of Power in particular). I've been having a hard time hearing myself properly. Just turning up the volume on my vocals didn't help much and it was always on the edge of feeding back. I'd always end up pushing to sing louder in order to hear myself and my voice would wear out very quickly.

Blue enCORE300 performance:  I've used several less expensive dynamic mics from Shure (SM57, SM58 and beta58A), a Senheiser e835 and even tried a considerably more expensive Audio Technica AE5400 condenser. Aside from the Shure SM57 they are all good vocal mics but the difference between them and the Blue enCORE 300 is dramatic.  The 300 has a far more natural, richer tone than any mic I've used before. The bottom end is full and the top end is crisp and detailed. It's difficult to describe exactly why but my vocals seemed to cut through the volume in the room.  I was able to relax and sing without pushing or straining and for once my high notes were intact at the end of the night. This mic allowed me to concentrate on my performance rather than constantly pushing for more volume just so I could hear myself.

Other reviewers have stated that the enCORE 300 is sensitive to plosives.  I can confirm that. Ps and Ts popped readily if I wasn't careful. It's going to take some getting used to but I'm not really concerned.

Our drummer got a Shure beta58A about a month ago, which he loved.  After both trying and listening to my new enCORE 300 he decided that he had to have one. He and our lead guitarist just bought enCORE 300s.  Four out of the five people who sing in the band now use enCORE 300s!

CONCLUSION:  My experience with the Blue enCORE 300 confirms everything people have said about it.  It's rich, detailed, clean, sensitive, powerful and a little touchy if you pop  your Ps.  It is easily the best vocal mic I've ever used. I gave it 5 stars because there is no option for 4  stars. The good things about it are so good that the one minor plosive problem is hardly worth mentioning.  Plus, it's really good looking. The pictures don't do it justice.

***UPDATE*** I used it again at practice last night. (3/12/15) I am more impressed than I was the first time. I was amazed at how different my voice sounds as compared to my old mic (which I really liked). All the subtlety and color that I try so hard to put into my vocals came through like never before. For the first time I actually sounded the way I intended to. The plosive issue I mentioned did not occur at all last night despite singing most of the same songs. I just had to be aware not to emphasize Ps and Ts... problem solved.

New rating: 5 Stars +",5.0
"These earbuds are surprisingly well made for the price point of ~$13. They are made of metal casings that have the feel of a more expensive product. They come in a round metal tin, within this tin is 1. the actual earbuds 2. various sizes and replacements for the inner ear 3. a splitter 4. a clip to attach to your clothing 5. a small mesh bag to store the product.

I have removed the foamy green portion and replaced them with on of the plastic black pieces included in the set as I feel they are more comfortable, and I'd like to hear some ambient noise in case of emergencies.

Overall sound is good. As stated in the product description, it is heavy on the bass.",5.0
"More like a short 3.5 stars....due to some features that are lacking on this head, which requires a separate preamp.  Here's the list; no input gain control, the di is pre eq, the single 12ax7 in the pre does not give natural tube warmth (you can get better by changing the tube, I got best results from a groove tube, electro Harmonix gave a slight bit more clarity and brightness over stock).  The power this puts out is great, but is very basic and steril (for lack of a better term, and not at all much of a detriment to the amp as tone from the bass is more transparent that way).  However, for those reasons, it gets the 3.5 star review from me.  When I used it, I had to use a variety of preamp/pedals to generate the tone I was looking for, so be prepared for that.  The pros....this is very simplistic, loud and has plenty of output versatility (which I miss).  To be able to run stereo at 500w per channel is an amazing feature that is not commonly found in a bass amp. It's built like a tank and never failed me for numerous gigs both indoor and outdoor doors with minimal pa support. So bottom line, if you're after a ton of clean headroom, and have a quality preamp or numerous pedals to put in front of this thing....you have yourself a very nice amp here that will rattle the windows out of most venues.",3.0
"I work for a big music store in Florida as a repair man. We get these and other chinese made saxophones in all the time for bent keys, misalignment, and pads wearing out prematurely.

One thing i wish it had was an adjustable bracket to angle once its on a truss or light stand. Its either you put it in the center of the room up high shining down, or have the light shine more the way of looking at a clock, rather than a disko ball.

The Artino pratice mute has a metal core covered with rubber -- safety and effectiveness together. It also comes in a nifty case that can nestle safely inside the case compartments and not spring out to damage the instrument.

Best practice mute I've ever found!",5.0

"Definitley does the job for a little hum/ground noise. People complain that this degrades your tone but it really doesn't. It takes a little bite out of your FIRST attacks if it's turned up too high but that's to be expected out of many different noise reducers. I keep mine in the FX loop for all around noise reduction. This works well if you have a lot of low noise-medium noise pedals. If you know the culprit pedal for noise, definitley put this pedal after it.

Great piece. Small footprint. I just leave it on all the time. You can't expect to eliminate ALL noise. Especially live - chances are whatever noise you hear when you're practicing alone at home will be un-noticable in a live setting.  In studio settings, there's no reason to engage your entire pedal board. Use this pedal wisely and it will work great!",4.0

"I recently purchased this shock mount and am thrilled with it. It's great value for the money and the VO work I've been doing from home already sounds markedly better. It's plastic, so I don't necessarily think of it as a PERMANENT solution, but I understand the company will be releasing a metal version which I look forward to getting my hands on when the time comes.

RE. THE BLUE YETI MOUNTING HOLE MANUFACTURING DEFECT: I have a Blue Yeti whose hole does NOT fit (for those of you not up on this, the Blue Yeti released a run - more? -of their mic where the mounting hole on the mic is, like, 1/16 an inch too wide!) Despite this, I was not interested in going through the time energy and effort of returning the shock mount or the defected mike. I am very happy with the mount purchase and the mike itself is a perfect solution / cost for what I'm up to with it right now.

So here's how I addressed the issue: I removed the little white felt ""cushion"" from the shock mount to get more ""depth"" from the mounting screw (don't think I'm losing TOO much of the shock mount's effectiveness by doing that) and then wrapped the threads of the screw with several layers of plumbers tape (the ultra-thin tape you put on water fixtures to ensure a water tight seal). It seems to do the trick and be secure.

No other problems so far!

Well done, Auphonix! I'm sorry to understand you're getting flak for this mounting hole fiasco when it's clearly Blue Yeti's misstep.",5.0
"I have played around with the Bugera 333XL for almost 2 weeks now. It has met my expectations. The clean tone is rich and warm. The gain channels are great for hard rock, punk, hardcore, and metal. I would say the gain is grainy when cranked too high (yes, there is such thing as too much gain) but setting your tone is simple and you have diversity. You can produce many different tones, which is perfect for creating ""your"" sound.

Perfect for rhythm guitar. Solos sound good but perhaps pedals and other things will optimize your sound.",5.0
"I got this for my son to use along with a microphone because he just loves the sound of his own voice. I wanted something inexpensive, easily portable, and with adjustable volume.

"This was super easy to use - zero dead cables, everything worked the first try.

I have a board of twelve pedals. Deciding which new layout option to try too longer than actually install the cables. Having the flexibility to put a pedal anywhere on my board but keep it in the signal path the way I want was really fantastic. Note how my boost is on the edge of my board now where it's easy to reach. Normally it would be to the left of the wah and harder to hit.

Being able to whip up a custom-length cable makes this 1000 times easier than being stuck with pre-made 6, 12, 18"" lengths. Plus it is way cleaner which makes it easier to spot trouble and tidy up the underside of the board.

At first I used a multimeter to test each connection but after the first couple I was pretty confident. So instead I left an off-the-shelf patch cable at the start of my pedal chain and another at the end. This way I could install the lava cable and quickly test connectivity from end-to-end. If you do that trick, make sure any buffered pedals have power.

I also got a bunch of free space now, so I Needs More Pedals.

"The Hohner Pro harp has a very similar sound to the Lee Oskar but the painted black
paint made it slower and not as smooth on the lips as well as before long flaking.
The Seydel Session had the best feel in the hands with its thicker yet tampered ends lower profile, but pretty mellow and not as reedy or defined in sound. This would be my preferred harp when amplified, as one could adjust the tone at the amp controls.
All good harps at comparably good prices.
PS  If your a beginner it's probably best to buy a G major harp which is mid in range and neither to high or low or as a second choice a C major.
Happy Harping...

"This pedal is great, not only because it has great tone, but also because of its extreme cheapness. I plug this in through my Marshall MG15CF amp ( practice amp) and it sounds great played through my Strat. It's Tone knob gives the sound a more thick, almost muddy sound when turned to the left, while turning it to the right gives it a much more clear, defined, but treble-y sound.  The level knob controls the volume of the pedal itself ( I'm not 100% sure about this, I'm relatively new) and the Dist. knob controls the amount of distortion overall, going from barely there to crushing gain. I have gear that would be classified as beginner gear ( 15w Marshall practice amp, and decent Squier Strat) but this pedal still sounds great and coax a multitude of passable tones ( Nirvana, Guns n' Roses, Metallica-ish, etc) from the amp. I would recommend this to anyone as the ultimate standby distortion pedal, a mainstay of rockers everywhere.

"If you are looking at a trejon, you may have already played a cajon.  For those who have not, a cajon is like a nice size wood box (think of a crate you could use as a stool) you sit on and and play the front surface of with your hands.  The playing surface is usually wood and the interior is hollow, providing a nice Thlapt Thla Thlapt Thla Thlapt Thplat ... sound as you strike it with your fingers or palm.

Videos on youtube or the Meinl site will provide you some practical tips on playing.  Some of the videos on youtube are inspirational at the amount of sound you can get from one tone - cajons typically produce only a single tone, usually bass or snare.

The Trejon is a natural offspring of the cajon.  The real difference is that it has three separate playing surfaces:  bass (bottom 2/3), midrange (top left), and snare (top right).  It is slightly lower and wider than a traditional cajon; however, is taller in person than it looks in the photos, where it appears fairly squat.

The sound quality is excellent and the sound of each playing surface is markedly different. It sounds more like a drum kit.  The bass in particular is quite deep and full and changes in tone over the playing surface, the deepest sounds coming from the middle, while the midtone and snare portions are surprisingly uniform across there smaller playing surfaces.  To my ear the bass section sounds closer to a traditional drum than most cajons which have a slightly hollow / woody sound. Also, would add that the angled playing surface is a plus.

A few minor differences over traditional cajon that are worth noting:

1.  it does feel slightly wider to sit on.

2.  because the bass is at the lowest point, you must lean further forward and closer to the floor to play (on a cajon you can sit almost upright, whereas with a trejon you will be slightly more hunched over to reach the bass)

3.  if you travel, there is not yet a ready made case for the trejon, though the company is reportedly coming out with one in 2010.

4.  also worth noting that cost is significantly more than a traditional cajon which can be had for $100 to $200 depending on quality and sound.

I debated on whether to buy several cajons or work on one instrument with several playing surfaces, and so far have been pleased with choosing the trejon.  Its versatility makes it more fun to play and practice on.

Factors from most important to least important in considering a rating:

Sound quality: 5+ stars
Build quality: 5 stars
Comfort in playing: 3.5 stars
Cost versus what you get for your money: 4 stars

True review would give it 4.5 stars, but the surprisingly good sound will give it the benefit of rounding up rather than down.  And overall, would say it is a worthy alternative to a mono-sound cajon.

Hope this review helps.",5.0

"I'm posting my review over a year after I bought this case.
As far as doing the job, yes, it's great. It fit my Bb, my C and my piccolo with absolutely no problems, and using my little blocks to make a perfect fit was like playing ""trumpet legos"" to my roommate and I. I was extremely pleased with this case after buying it, and continued to like it for a while. But within the first 6 months, I had issues with the zippers. First, it was the front pocket. The zipper had managed to detach itself a little, which led to that strange phenomenon where you zip and it doesn't actually zip anything because the tines don't quite line up. After zipping from one end for a while, I managed to find a solution that just meant I couldn't open up the pocket all the way, which is fine. The next issue was when the zipper for the case started detaching itself. Slowly but surely, the zipper is coming off the case, and though I could hand sew it back on (probably never quite as good as a machine could do) the material on the zipper seems cheap (the fabric of the case itself is high quality nylon and I've had no problems with that) and I fear that I'd just have to keep resewing it, or eventually replacing the zipper which with the hard shell of the case would be a hassle and a half. I hear that protec has a lifetime warranty, but I didn't keep the paperwork. The lifetime warranty would work out well-- but when you'd need repairs every year or so, I don't think this choice is worth it.
The major pro, however, with this case is the cost. This case is inexpensive, does the job, and protects your horn momentarily. The issue is that this case isn't a lifer. It'd be fine if used sparingly for those few gigs you need all 3 horns, but it's not for everyday use. As a college student, the price was right. But I've since had to invest a little bit more money into a more expensive case...which happened to be used, but still of much much better quality and well worth the investment.
I'm on the fence with protec. I want to like them because they're affordable and trying to create items that mimic the more expensive ones on the market, but they just don't seem to hold up.",3.0

"I was looking for a small set of active speakers to build into in a custom keyboard stand. These fit the bill perfectly because they are compact and have a really nice sound. They also have up to 4 input sources that are summed (stereo 1/4"" rca, stereo 1/8"" mini jack, stereo trs jacks, and USB) - this allows you to have multiple sources playing simultaneously if you want. That's nice for my purposes because I sometimes like to play the keyboard along with music on my iPod. The USB is also an output so you can record the output (all summed inputs) on a computer if you want. When the headphones are inserted, the speakers are automatically silenced.

I designed the keyboard stand you see in the customer photos to fit these exact speakers. The Alesis are better than most of the built-in speakers you get with a portable keyboard and these certainly offer more functionality. The outer shell of these are some type of hard plastic - they feel well made - not cheap. The only real issue I have with these is that the cable they provide for connecting up the two speakers is too short - only about 3 ft. So if you want to separate these by a distance of more than 3ft. you'll have to buy a longer cable (1/8"" mini jack on both ends).

Pros:
- nice sound
- plenty loud
- *compact (5"" x 7.5"" x 6""; Width of front face x Height of front face x Depth of cabinet)
- active (amplifier built-in)
- 4 input sources
- sturdy construction
- volume pot is quiet when turned (hopefully will remain that way)

Cons:
- blue power LED a bit too bright
- cable provided for tethered speaker could be longer (it's about 3 ft.)

"I was replacing some Grover Flower Pot tuners with Grover Sta-tite tuners which are more Kluson style. The bushings that come with the sta-tites were too small for the Grover hole, so an adapter was necessary. These bushings worked well if you are looking to do the same thing. Here is what I found while installing them. Some of the holes in the head stock were slightly tighter than others allowing for some bushings to fit snugly. I was worried because some of the bushings would fall out of the headstock whenever I tipped the guitar. They all seemed really tight once you got the screws in the tuning machine locked in though. An additional friction agent could also keep them secure. And once string tension was on the post, the bushings were all really tight preventing any unwanted rattling. I hope this is helpful. I didn't find too much specific info on this project, so I wanted to inform any one looking to do the same thing. It is possible that the holes for your Grover tuners are larger than the ones for my headstock. The holes in my headstock were done in the factory and not by me. So if you have a stock unmodified Gibson that you are looking to retrofit with Kluson style tuners, this should work. Note that there will be a faint mark of where the Grover washer sat on the headstock that will be visible with these bushings unless you find a replacement washer. The Grover washer would not work with these bushings without modification. Happy customizing. By the way, the Grover Sta-tites are amazing tuning machines. 18 to 1 ratio is the only way to go. Having played guitar for 20 years and having had many high end new and vintage guitars, I can tell you that the sta-tites offer a classy, snappy, and excellent tone upgrade from the heavy Grover style or lower ratio Kluson style tuning peg.",5.0
The Hoof Fuzz is one of the best Fuzz pedals you will ever hear. It has tone shaping controls such as theShift knob others do not have.  If you want to spend over 300 dollars on a crazy fuzz with lots of useless add ons go ahead. This is a solid fuzz that is so good you could record with it or go on tour.,5.0

"This was easy to apply to the bridge, and is made entirely of rubber so it won't leave any scratches. But I'm not too impressed with this mute. It's cheap for a reason. While it does mute the sound of my violin ever so slightly, it does not mute near enough to practice with while there are others in the house. It just isn't weighty enough to be of any real use.",3.0

"Incredible Value!  I'm a ""near"" audiophile, built my own amps in the 70's, and have over 1,000 CDs.  Using headphones ot experience very high quality sound has become my way of enjoying my music now.  I've owned a number of headphones over the years with some costing nearly five hundred dollars.  Honestly the CB-1s and OB-1s are my favorite of all time!  They are definately different and I enjoy both for different situaitons.  When working in my office, I'm a photographer, I use the OB-1s becasue I love the expanded sound stage, when in a room with others, or on a plane,  not wanting to disturb anyone with my concert level sound, I use the CB-1s.  Both are close to flat across the specturm but still have good bass, just not sloppy like Beats, the mid and upper frequencies are near perfect to my ears.  I find them both comfortable to listen to for long sessions, at least a couple of hours and I never  have fatigue as I do with some other highy regarded units.  If you are listening to headphones in a store and find some that sound amazing, often, over time they will wear you out,.  The Status headphones are articulate but never tiring, and I find they reproduce instruments and voice nearly perfectly!  You simply can't go wrong with these headphones, both, and at this price you can own both pair!  I've given 3 pairs away to friends and family and still have one of each for myself!!!",5.0

"I run a Sandy Bridge Window's 10 machine and the 6i6 has given me nothing but issues since I got it in 7/2016. The audio crackles, pops, and distorts CONSTANTLY. Typically I have to reboot my machine or disable & re-enable the device in Window's Sound settings to get it working again. Usually this only lasts a few hours before I have to do it all over again. Many times when I boot up Pro Tools, I get no sound at all and I have to quit the application and perform the above operations just to make it work. I constantly keep an eye on their beta site to test out their newest drivers in hopes of a fix, but most of the releases I've tested seem worse than the previous. If you need something stable or for serious audio work, I'd recommend NOT buying the Scarlett 6i6. I have no idea how other people have had such good experiences with it.",1.0

"These guitar ukes can sound great if set up properly. The A.C.E. version of the 9126 sounds a little muted compared to the non cutaway/preamped straight 9126 when played acoustically. So the straight 9126 would be better if you don't really need the amp. The real bone saddle and nut really help the sound. The Gretsch 6 string have more of a boomchuck sound, compared to the Cordoba 6 string uke. Common issues seem to be twisted necks, uneven frets, and loose electronics, so check for those.",4.0

I was looking for a good quality power supply that gave me lots of options.  This fits the bill.  It's very heavy duty.  It came with all of the appropriate cables to connect to most any pedals you have.  Right now I'm powering 9 pedals with this.  Each spot puts out 300mA so you can daisy chain certain pedals like overdrives and compressors that only take a few mA's to run.  I put my power hungry digital pedals on their own spot.  It also gives you the option to power one at 18volts which is awesome for some overdrives.  I'm very happy with this and I love the bright blue LED when it's on.  It glows from under my pedal board.,5.0

"I've been playing harmonica for the past 3 years and have played pretty much all of them.  As I have
  been improving greatly, I'm finding that most harps are pretty responsive on their own way.
  For the past year I have been focused exclusively on the Suzuki Bluesmasters and several keys of
  Suzuki's Promaster.  The Bluesmaster was very helpful in my learning stages because it is so easy
to play.
  I decided to take my Lee Oskars out of storage and am finding that it is easier to play than it was in
  my earlier stages of growth.  The G is particularly gorgeous in tone and character and I will now be
  focusing on it and the A major key.  I also like the low F.  Sure happy I didn't throw them away.
  I have had few reed problems because I'm not a hard blower.  I made some slight adjusts on stuck
  reeds which worked out fine.  Another benefit of Lee Oskars is that you can replace the reed plates for about $20.
  I definitely wouldn't mind spending that much to get an essentially new harp.

"This is the second cajon I have purchased, the first being the Meinl Headliner.  At the time there was only one other review of this cajon, and the writer stated that it had a horrible sound with weak bass, etc.

I have no idea what he's talking about.  Although on the other hand, I'm just an amateur percussionist, and maybe he's an expert and has had way more experience with this type of drum.  I only have a few points of reference.

To me, this cajon is a significant upgrade.  The bass is way deeper, and the snare is much more crisp.  And I purchased this when it was on some kind of reduced price (less than $60).  With the Meinl Headliner (which is considered an entry-level cajon), I had trouble getting a good snare sound and needed a Cajonport to enhance the sound, but with this cajon it played well right out of the box.",5.0

I produces a very cool bluesy sound on my Gretsch  Jim Dandy, though I am still just noodling with it. :)

Same as most other's experience, this ""medium"" slide has a rather small inner diameter - I have small/medium hands, and while this slide fits my pinky with wiggle room to spare, it's a tight fit on my ring finger.

Construction is very nice, the interior finish is comfortable.  Treat it with care and it should last  forever.

"I got my drumset earlier than expected. When I opened the box everything was disassembled except for the snare which was already put together. The set is wonderful I love it. The only thing that you will need to do is get better heads for everything because the ones it comes with aren't very good, and they don't have a very clean sound when you hit them. I have yet to get new heads, but I have replaced my snared head to an awesome power coated Remo. All my heads have a strip of cloth underneath of them to tune out the extra sound, which makes them sound much better. All in all, everything works wonderfully and I love the hardware, sticks, seat high hat stand. the con for this is the symbols that comes with the set, they are fake, and my nephew has a child's drumset and its made out of the exact same material, so expect to replace the crappy crash ride and your high hat symbols. I do recommend this to anyone who is wanting to start playing the drums or looking for a nice set at an affordable price.",5.0
"The interface itself is decent. It's well built, good signal & sound, and looks pretty. The reason why this isn't a 5 star review is because of the software. Ableton is cool. But I got it for the Pro Tools First. Even with all the system requirements met, Pro Tools First started crashing on the second day. Then on the third day it wouldn't even launch. And tech support was slow and difficult to access... not very helpful.

I was very disappointed as an aspiring Pro Tools user. I say ""previously"" because I've now decided to switch to Studio One due to this experience.

Also with Pro Tools First, you only get 3 projects unless you purchase their subscription. So unless you absolutely can't live without the interface itself, and you love Ableton Live, and/or are planning on purchasing the FULL Pro Tools software, you might want to reconsider investing your money on this deal.

I've since returned the Focusrite in exchange for the Presonus Audiobox that comes with Studio One Artist and I'm much happier now. The interface is solid (although not as aesthetically pleasing as the Scarlett), and the Studio One Artist DAW is just as powerful as Pro Tools and in some ways much easier to work with.

"The first one of these that arrived at our doorstep had split wood in a screwhole in the cavity for the tremolo (unacceptable since a lot of time goes into setting up a Floyd for the first time and during changes in tuning & string guages), but the second one seems flawless.

Can't believe Amazon sells this solid mahogany set neck ebony-fingerboard guitar with FRT-1000 tremolo (basically a Floyd Original made outside Germany) for such a low price. It's light, gigantor-sized, ready for any obnoxious metal/rock antics,, and plays like a dream.

The Time Capsule pickups and Floyd make it sound thinner and brighter than my Epiphone Les Paul 100 (also mahogany), but the sound is beautiful in its own way.  Not that visions of adding a big, brass sustain block aren't dancing in my head...

Bottom line, it's an ""epitome of effortless playing"" guitar with a distinctive sound and ""don't tell them, but..."" bargain of a pricetag. It's impossible to hold this guitar and not think ""how would Dime have played this song?"" even if ithe song is ""Wheels On the Bus.""",5.0

"I am a professional musician. Playing trumpet since 1960 , plus all other brass; Flugelhorn, Cornet, Piccolo Trumpet, Bass Trumpet etc.  I started straight.harp in 1953, and got my first 10 hole chrome in 1960 when I started trumpet in 7 th grade.  I used my  Universals trumpet method for both axes.  I spent 30 years in the armed forces music programs entertaining the troops on both brass and harps. I  a retired NYC Band director (25 years) and spent 32 years plaing lead, showband style trumpet in the national act, Randy and the Rainbows( Denise-63'). I was a member of the Long Island Harmonica Club and was its president one year.  My main harp in the club was octave bass. I did a gig in the Javitz Center with Jerry Murads Harmonicats on bass. I 'm not a big fan of the octave bass.  Even with the small one, I feel like I 'm hefting around a heavy brick and playing a grunting pig. When I ordered the Swan Senior, I wasn't expecting much.  It is a C to c single reed bass, and every one was saying that single reed basses don't carry. Boy was I pleasantly surprized. I am looking for a stand up , string double bass sound both plucked and bowed. I can achieve this on the Swan Senior, not on the hohner octave basses. I was very impressed both with the tone quality and the quality of the instruments build.  I feel its worth way more than I paid for it. Same thing with the compact 48 chord.  I can't believe that you fit 48 4 voiced chords, 24 per deck in just a 13 inch space and my chops do not feel cramped. Kudos to Swan for their ingenius engineering. Great harps all the way around.",5.0

"My daughter loves these and smiles when she shakes them.  They are the perfect fit for her 8 month old hands.  The rattle sound is pleasant enough, not too loud or annoying.

"As a band director I STRONGLY advise you NOT to purchase this ""Clarinet Shaped Object.""  A student brought this in my beginner clarinet class and being unfamiliar with the brand i wanted to try it and see if it was suitable.  I can barely make a sound on it.  The sound I got was thin and airy out of tune.  It was very very difficult to play.  If that was the case for me as the teacher, it will be nearly impossible for a student to play it and be successful on it.  Plus, my local repair guy says he would not even try to repair the instrument because the quality is so bad that any attempt at repairing it could damage it worse.  That and there are no parts available for the instrument.  If it were to be damaged, you would have to purchase another instrument.  If your child wants to play clarinet (or any instrument for that matter) please do not purchase a NEW instrument for $100.  You will get garbage!  Your child will struggle and quit if it doesn't break before then!  Instead buy a used quality instrument for a few hundred more so your child actually has a chance to enjoy it.  You are setting a child up for failure with an instrument like this.  If you don't know what a quality instrument, consult your local band director.  I'm sure they would be glad to help you as I am as a band director.",1.0

"I've been thinking about learning to play guitar for years. The reviews for this indicated it was a good, all-inclusive, package for beginners so I placed it on my wish list and left it up to fate.  Low and behold, I received it this past Christmas.  While I'm still too much of a beginner to know whether this kit was really appropriate for me, it does seem sufficient for the price.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to the glorious reviews posted here on Amazon.  While this isn't necessarily a bad kit, the glowing reviews hyped up the product to make it seem better than it actually is.  Basically, it is just OK.  If you are looking for a beginner guitar for an adult who might lose interest in it, this might be an economical starter kit.  That way, you haven't wasted too much money on a fly by night hobby.  Since I'm determined to actually learn to play, I may have been better off buying a guitar, gig bag, tuner and picks separately.  The guitar seems fairly sturdy.  I don't think the bridge can be adjusted but I probably need to learn how to play before I consider modifying the height of the strings.  Please note that this is a big guitar.  I'm 5'11"" tall and the guitar still feels too big for me.  This is typical of the dreadnought size; thus, it is to be expected; however, I probably should have chosen something smaller and more comfortable as a beginner.  That is my own fault as I should have done better research in advance.  My guitar teacher looked it over and thought it was a nice, quality, economy guitar so the instrument itself probably deserves  4 stars.  The 3 star rating is because of the other issues:  cheap gig bag and tuner.  Although the detailed product description above states that the gig bad is padded, it isn't.  It is just a dust cover with handles and pockets.  I have since learned that I will have to buy a better gig bag if I want to  protect my guitar as a I travel to lessons.  From my recent research into other gig bags, I've learned to look for the measurements of the padding.  Most padded gig bags include the width of the padding in the description (ex. 18mm-20mm).  Since no measurements are included in the product description for the Slivertone SD3000PAK, the reference to ""padding"" may have been a typo.  Oh well, you get what you pay for as gig bags can run anywhere from $25-$150.  Given that the whole Slivertone guitar kit was only $90, it makes sense that one wouldn't get a more costly, padded, gig bag.  I was also disappointed in the tuner.  Although it looks just like the one shown on my ""learn guitar"" DVD; it picks up all kinds of background noise (like the low hum/white noise sounds from my ventilation system and laptop).  Even with total silence, it seems to hear notes and keys that aren't actually being played.  Also, I found that you need to hold the tuner very close to the sound box of the acoustic guitar for it to recognize the notes being played.  Luckily, this kit was given to me as a gift.  I wasn't entirely sure whether I'd like the guitar so it wouldn't have made sense to put a really expensive kit on my wish list.  While I suspect that once I become reasonably proficient at the guitar, I will purchase a better quality instrument; however, this should be fine for my first year.  I do plan to upgrade to a better gig bag and tuner soon...probably within the next month or so.",3.0

"Shure makes good equipment.  I own a lot of it.  I use mine (2) for audience participation in recorded conference room presentations.  The size and color are good for minimizing their visibility on camera.  The gooseneck allows for aiming.  The difference that I noticed with this mic has more to do with the pickup pattern.  Previously, I was using Shure ceiling mounted button mics with an omni-directional pattern.  I ordered this mic with a cardioid pattern, not super c, and there's a noticeable difference - less hiss and less off axis clutter.  I would add that, for normal voice recording in a quiet room, the distance to source needs to be 3 feet or less.  Finally, I suggest taking a sound print of a silent room and applying it to the recordings in post.",5.0

"For the money, this is a great product.  The setup was pretty much flawless when I pulled it from the box.  It had been in a box for roughly 6 months when I received it (I checked the inspection date), and the intonation, the string action, and the guitar was actually very close to in tune!  I checked the finish carefully, but could not find anything at all significant to point out.  The guitar resonates well and the slightly higher output Alnico's make be prefer this guitar over the 50's CV version (which I owned.)

While very solid, this does not compare to higher end Stratocasters, but competes VERY well with a Standard American Strat, and frankly does a better job than the Mexican strats that I've played...all at a lower price point.

Shipping was not much more for 2 day shipping, so it showed quickly.

Clearly Fender knows they did this one right, as when I first looked at all of these, they were JUST over $300.  Now they're going for close to $400.  Still an excellent value for a casual user, and even a professional who wants a stage guitar for those places you don't want to leave your $2000+ Strat sitting out and about.",4.0

"Gave it 2 stars, because 3 on the Amazon scale means ""it's okay"" - and for a brand new product these aren't.

If you have pedals close together, you'll have to keep these cables in the U-shape, as the default image for this product illustrates. I was not getting signal on one of my cables when they were in this shape. I would only get signal when the cable was lying completely straight between the two pedals. This usually is a problem for older cables after they've been beaten in and stressed - it's a sign that the solder joint or the connecting is being taxed or breaking down, and that the pressure that the cables get when they're being warped in the U-shape is preventing the signal from flowing.

I really wish I'd just put up the extra $4-$6 to buy the product from an actual name brand company.",2.0

You can definitely hit all of the notes, but you have to blow harder than what I expected. Because of this, learning how to play is a bit more challenging. This is a great ocarina to add to any collection, but I feel like it's not so great for anyone starting out.

"The dt1770 is a headphone that is plagued with driver rattling issues, as many of the reviewers have stated. I found a solution to fix this issue by playing some music or a youtube frequency test where the driver is primarily known to rattle (this should be low bass music). Just repeatedly slap the outter side of the earcup that is known to rattle while the music is playing and the rattling should be fixed, it is really that simple. It worked for me, but it is still unacceptable that a premium headphone of this price would be plagued by quality control issues.

Ignore the reviewers saying this is a neutral headphone, it is as ""neutral"" as a dt770. They lean more torwards ""fun sounding"" as beyerdynamic is typically known for. It has a bassy sound signature with deep, powerful, and hard hitting bass that still avoids being muddy. Mids are a bit withdrawn and somewhat unnatural but nowhere near unlistenable. The somewhat withdrawn mids are what make these headphones have a very wide soundstage for a closed back which in my opinion is a worthy trade off. The treble has a sparkle that helps everything sound clean and clear. The comfort is pretty good but still far from ""wear and forget,"" you will always know you are wearing them. They have great isolation with the pleather earpads, much better than any other closed back headphone I own. Speaking of earpads, the replaceable earpads are kind of a joke since they are so inconveniently hard to put back on once you remove them. Pressing on each earcup exhibits a creaking sound which is extremely disappointing considering how beautiful these headphones are",3.0

"Been playing guitar for over 15 years, but have always hated how much a decent guitar costs.  It's a hobby, and I don't want to spend $600 just for a good acoustic/electric.  When I found the Yamaha, I was very skeptical.  But, I went to a local guitar shop, played one there and found that I really liked it.  Came back and ordered it online for cheaper.
It has very low action but, unlike a lot of acoustics set up this way, has absolutely no buzzing.  All the hardware is reliable and holds the tuning extremely well.  The guitar is lightweight but sturdy and the internal pickup is great.  There's a lot of wiggle room when it comes to what sounds you're looking to make.
There are only a few things which are cons:
 - Because it is a thin body, the guitar doesn't have great volume if it's not plugged in.  If you're playing with other musicians, you'll need an amp.
 - Doesn't come with a gig bag or case.
 - The strap peg on the to of the guitar is placed oddly, making it hard to get your strap right.
 - Only comes in one color (which I don't mind, I like the natural look, but some others don't)
 - Has a composite top.  Lots of guitar snobs would complain about this, saying that you HAVE to have a solid hardwood top.  My response?  Whatever.  It sounds fine, and once you run it through an amp and play with the pickup, no one can tell.

In short - great guitar for the money.  Perfect for beginners/intermediate and non-picky pros.",5.0

I normally wait a couple weeks (or more) before I write my review on things, but I'm actually excited about writing how useful this is.

For those who don't wish to read my entire review and to sum it all up in the end, BUYING ONE OF THESE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

First of all the description (and packaging manual itself) says it's for the use of the Mandolin or Banjo, but the Amazon search of ""Ukulele Capo"" and also by a couple other reviews on this product used this on the Ukulele. So even though it doesn't say it's for the ukulele, it still works fine on the Ukulele.

Durability: It's not plastic that's for sure and the tension of it feels like one of those exercise grips, but I'm pretty sure most people can be able to squeeze on those to take it off/on plus the slightly hard grip keeps the capo in place much better.

Looks and ergonomics: It's funny how the capo was smaller than I expected, it's about the size of my palm in length. The part that sticks out of the instrument goes upwards from the frets (K-style; the best I could describe that) and shouldn't get in the way while doing some chords unlike some other capos I've seen where the part that sticks out is on the opposite side and could get in the way. Overall I'm pretty happy with it.

Sounds: The reason why I got the capo was because I wasn't really happy with the sounds my ukulele makes (it didn't seem pleasant to hear for me), but ever since I put the capo on the first fret I could never seem to take it off anymore because I loved how it sounds now! Plus, having a capo allow you to change the pitch of the sounds to whatever you want, so you're basically not stuck with the same sounds on every song and you can play around the pitches to be more creative while jamming with the buddies! It's just a whole new world with a capo.

Other stuff: The instructions specifically say not to attach the capo onto the headstock (the tail end of the ukulele), but I see everyone doing this anyways when they're not in use (I put mines on the middle of the top of the headstock so the whole rubbery part is on the instrument and not just a part of it). Although I do understand why they don't want you to put it there because the thick rubber of the capo (that attaches to the strings) conforms to the shape of the strings (when I take off the capo, I would see lines on the rubbery part of it) and putting it on the headstock would make the flat surface uneven after a while. The manual also recommends that you should take the capo off when not in use which again has something to do with the rubber (and I think it would mess the strings up too).

HOW TO PROPERLY PUT YOUR CAPO: Naturally, one would put the capo on the middle of the fretboard. That is wrong. The correct position of the capo should be closest to (without touching the bar) the next fret. Basically, if you're going to put the capo on the first fret, the capo should be closer to the second fret. If you're going to go up a step to the second fret, then the capo should be closer to the third fret and so on. Get it? I hope so. Just don't keep it in the middle of the fretboard.

To properly play the new chords, basically the capo is the new nut part of the ukulele. So if you put the capo on the first fret, then you would play the chords one fret down from your original normal chord.

Well, that's about it for now. I'll update this review if anything comes up. As for now, I'm going to be busy jamming on my ukulele! :]",5.0

"There are maybe 3 different brands of these sun-type guitar straps. I have two of them, one of which is the Perri's Leathers. Compared to the others I own, Perri's has the brightest and most vibrant colors. The other straps appear kind of dull compared to them. I'm using the Perri's red sun strap with a cherry sunburst guitar and it compliments it very well. I have the blue Perri's sun strap with an acoustic guitar with a plain finish and may also use one on a sky or daphne blue electric. I would suggest the black sun strap with not just a black guitar, but one that had any black in it, such as a black pick guard. These straps are very distinctive and they  stand out. The only thing that I don't like is the very visible ""P"" in white - obviously for the Perri's name - inscribed on the one leather end of the strap. I'll buy your strap because it's good, but I paid for it so I don't think I have to advertise for you, you know? It's not a deal breaker; I might be able to scrape it off or I'll just reverse the ends so it's behind me. All things considered, I'd say it's a sharp strap and I'd buy it again.",5.0

"In regards to the previous review, this is a tenor ukulele made from laminate wood. A quick glance at the cross section on the f-holes makes this clear. For the money, the wood should be better, but it's still a decent instrument in a decent package. Let's break it down piece by piece.

The Uke

Appearance: It looks really nice. The age-effect finish, Pearloid purfling and sunburst front combine to give it a classic jazz look. The important hardware (floating bridge, nut, tuners, and frets) give smooth and clean action.

**UPDATE: I raised the action on the uke by sliding the floating bridge down towards the tailpiece to get a better sound (see below). The action comes from the factory as so low that if you lower it even slightly, it starts to buzz.**

Sound: The sound is the weak point of this ukulele. The bass is strong, thanks to the arched front and back, and the mids are passable, mostly from the floating bridge. The highs are a little weaker, but with different strings it might have better balance. It is very punchy, though, which I like, especially for jazz and blues, where some ukuleles just sound weak. If you change your attack to a more aggressive, bluesy style, the uke really comes alive. Don't be afraid to hit it hard to get the most out of the instrument. It's worth it in this case.

The main thing that will improve the sound is letting the wood open up. I'll edit this review in a month or so and note how the sound has changed, but in the meantime, if you buy this (or any wooden instrument), be prepared to let the wood grain expand and open before you make your final judgment on the sound. Watch this space for updates.

**UPDATE: I've played this uke for a month now, and changed to some punchier strings (D'Addario Black Nylon Wound-C). I also raised the action slightly to get more volume. These two changes made a noticeable difference, as has the wood opening up to the extent that laminate wood will. Overall, it's not the best sound or the strongest, but it still has its charms. That said, for the price, it really should sound better. I originally rated this at 4 stars, but I'm revising that to three.**

Extras

The case is a cheap nylon gig bag that's probably not appropriate for the arched front and back of the uke, and in fact barely fits over it. The tuner is good, and quite accurate, even allowing for a rough approximation of cents. The cleaning cloth is definitely worth having. It's 9""x9"": strong and soft. I haven't watched the DVD.

This Uke and its brothers are advertised as jazz ukuleles. They certainly look the part, and even before the wood has opened up the rough, guttural tones and the punchy basses and mids make it sound like an old, worn-in jazz guitar. Don't trade in your high-end uke for it, but if you like and play jazz on the uke, this instrument would make a nice addition to your collection, if you can spare the money.",3.0

"Junk.
I'm an beginning band director and I've had several students show up with these instruments. Please trust me - I've probably had 20 kids with Mendinis and have a lot more experience than one parent who (at the time of a review) had a positive outlook.  Band directors all cringe at the name of Mendini, or any other of the cheap Amazon instruments. They. Do. Not. Last.

1. Really, they do not last. I've never had a student play on one for more than a year. They break all the time. Constantly. Weekly, sometimes. Because they are cheap, noname instruments, they can't be fixed by repair shops because replacement parts don't exist and/or don't work. Many repair shops refuse to even try to fix it because even if it could be fixed, the metal is so thin, cheap, and brittle that it will either break or bend right back. Kids get frustrated when their instrument is never working and then quit.

2. The tone is horrible. Absolutely horrible. This is not me being a picky band director - the kids even notice it and point it out. Nobody wants their kid to be singled out because they are doing some poorly - and it's not even the kid's fault!

3. The tuning is extremely off. This is noticeable by the kids as well. It's to the point where the instrument is playing a completely different note than the one that it is supposed to sound like. No amount of adjustment from the kid or teacher will fix this. Your child will stick out and be embarrassed.

4. No resale value. The instrument will not last long enough to even have value after a few months, but even if it did, it will not hold value. Good instruments are atill valuable years after - people are still playing on instruments from the 40s. In a few months, you will be stuck with a perpetually broken instrument that either you will pour money in to trying to fix it, or that is so broken it can't be fixed and then you are flat out of that money.

I understand; band is expensive. But you could take this money and find a used instrument - a good brand- and end up with something that will WORK! If that's not an option, talk to your school's band director to see if they have school instruments available.

Trust me - this is NOT band director approved. We call Mendinis 'instrument shaped objects' because that is exactly all they are.",1.0

"I just got my drumset  this year, and didn't realize quality cymbals were so expensive.  So far, I've purchased used hi hats, a ride, and a crash.  I wanted to extend my sound by adding a splash or a china cymbal, but I didn't want to spend money on both.

This cymbal allowed me to buy both.  In a way, it is a splash cymbal with a short decay and lower tone.  Yet it still has the slight sound of a china.

However, the real fun comes in when you piggyback it with other cymbals.  If you put it on top, facing down, it actually lengthened the decay of my 16"" crash, but not so much on the 18"" ride.  On the ride, though, it gives you a really low tone china effect when you strike it like a crash.  That makes it easier on my ears.  You can ping the cymbals normally, without much effect, but when you do a crash you can hear the trashformer working.

You can also put it upside down on top of another cymbal.  This causes the trashformer to roll around, and the decay is about normal on the other cymbals.  However, the cool part is that you can strike both cymbals at the same time or separately, either with the same stick or different sticks (depending on the size o fthe cymbal).

I'm going to have to pick up a second one just to have both a stand-alone splash/effect and one to roll around on top of the crash.  I have to check out the other sizes first, though.

Note:  the trashformers sort of look like the clock in Salvador Dali's painting-- there are 3 dips in the material.  This makes the 8"" a little hard to hit when it is a stand-alone effect cymbal, unless you have it close to you so you can see what part o f the cymbal you are striking.  It's not a deal-breaker, though.",5.0

"I bought my first Shubb capo almost 25 years ago, and although the metal arm shows some wear from repeated use it still works perfectly.  Because I play a number of different guitars I now keep a Shubb capo in each case (along with other basic guitar supplies).  When I added these additional capos I purchased ""Shubb Deluxe"" models for each guitar.

As for the reviewers who've noted problems with intonation, any guitarist worth his salt knows that you must as carefully place a capo on the strings as you place your finger on the fretboard.  The Shubb Deluxe is the best at applying _equal_ pressure to all the strings across the fretboard, creating what is essentially a second nut.  Mechanically you are shortening the overall effective string length which also effects the range of usable intonation, and more significantly effects the timbre of the string/instrument.  Be sure to _carefully_ place the capo over the strings, making sure that the capo is near-perfectly parallel with and immediately behind the fret bar.  The closer the capo is placed to the fret bar the less pressure is required to keep the strings in firm contact and the truer the intonation.  This is the same principle you [should] use when fingering a string.  ""Less [pressure] is more [better intonation].""

I'm still pleased with my original Shubb, but the Deluxe is superior in every respect -- especially intonation -- and this is the only capo I will use on my Traugott guitars.

"I purchased this ocarina about a year ago because it was one of the most affordable I could find for a quality product. I'm no professional, but it sounds amazing. If you're hesitating because of the low price, you should know this is a real musical instrument, perfectly in tune with a fully chromatic one octave range and a bright, resonant sound. Conversely, just because it's affordable, please do not give this lovely ocarina to your children as a ""toy"" to play with if they have more interest in goofing around than learning a musical instrument. It may be durable as a rock, but it's not a toy for them to ruin. Treat it with the respect you would accord a piccolo. The ocarina is an old instrument, which means that accurate pitch and quality of sound will depend a lot on your breath control and your accuracy in covering up the holes. But with a little patience and practice, it will reward you.

It seems a shame to me that you can't find any sound samples of this beautiful instrument, so I will offer one here. If you're curious to see what this ocarina sounds like, here's a link to a short song played on this exact instrument, covering most of the notes. I hope it will be helpful to you with your purchasing decision.

"This product has to be one of the greatest audio interfaces that I have been in contact with. It works extremely well with my Windows 7 machine, along with Cubase.

"I was honestly scared to purchase this because it was just so inexpensive. Other reviews had me wondering if it would 1) work for my needs or 2) come to me DOA. Originally, I was in search of a midi-USB cable to connect my LINE 6 Flextone III XL guitar amp to my computer for tone editing. After reading so many recommendations to purchase the M-Audio UNO USB-midi cable (for *cough* FORTY BUCKS *cough*) I thought there had to be something cheaper. I found it!

The cable comes packaged in a clear cellophane wrapper with a little leaflet instruction sheet. Nothing else but the twist ties. Plugged it into my Vista laptop (V6.0.6002 SP 2) and ""ker-plunk"" it was recognized by the operating system and drivers successfully installed automatically. NICE! After I set up the software for use with my amp (the LINE 6 software, not cable software as there is none) it works like a frik'n charm. I'm not sending massive amounts of midi data back and forth so I can't say how well it would work for heavier applications. For what I'm using it for, however, --sending small data files back and forth-- its absolutely perfect. I've only been using it for a couple days so I cannot attest to the product's longevity.

Bottom Line: HIGHLY RECOMMEND especially for those requiring simple USB-midi cables.",5.0

That isn't a big deal if you need to boom your music/movies in media room, but if you need to take that type of performance on the road you options are more limited. There are a variety of bluetooth speaker and ipod docks and while many of them are easy to use and highly portable they are rarely loud. In fact, the Pyle Pro 15"" Powered Speaker passes the loudest bluetooth speaker that I have used (The Supertooth Disco Twin) at less than 30% of its total volume.

  Make no mistake, the Pyle Pro 15"" Powered Speaker is not intended to compete against small bluetooth speakers. Not even close. This speaker is designed to fill large spaces with with sound. It can fill anything from backyards, dance halls, to church auditoriums with total sound. In the video portion of the review you can see how loud it is at only 40% of its total volume (I was afraid to turn it up much louder for fear of upsetting my neighbors!).

  The best part of the speaker is the cost - the Pyle Pro 15"" costs less (significantly less)  than most 15"" subwoofers that are the market. The Pyle Pro offers 1400 watts of power, a 1.75"" titanium horn tweeter, multiple types of inputs, a hard plastic shell at a very reasonable price.

Notes-

- In terms of sound performance - as mentioned it is very loud.... in all settings. This speaker is loud enough to be used for DJ'ing weddings at dance hall (or a fraternity party).

- I like it for use as the primary speaker for outdoor movies. I combine this speaker with a projector to show backyard movies - with the right set-up  this can make for an awesome neighborhood movie night.

- The sound quality is more than acceptable, but it is hardly subtle. An audiophile may complain that the bass is a bit punchy and that the horn tweeter can come across as bright... and the combination means that the midrange is a bit undervalued.... but who really cares? A Two-way, 1400 watt speaker that features a 15"" woofer is not designed to have the cleanest  most subtle soundstage.

- Frequency response of 40Hz to 22kHz - although I would not be surprised if the frequency response was a little lower than the 40Hz.

- Has a microphone input which allows it to be used as a public address speaker or for Karaoke.

- The built in iPod/iPhone dock is a nice feature, but it is a bit awkward to use. I greatly prefer to use (although it is not included) the Aux-to-RCA splitter and directly plug the speaker into the headphone jack of my iPad.

- Allows you to insert a SD memory card to play music directly from a memory card

- Features a small remote control that is mainly used for use with the SD memory card.

- Has a USB input so you can play music from any source that has an USB output.

- Has gain controls for both bass and treble

- Using an auxiliary output-to-RCA splitter and a small bluetooth device (like the Jabra Clipper) you can turn the Pyle Pro Powered Speaker into a HUGH and LOUD bluetooth speaker.

- Has a hard plastic shell which has been pre-tapped so that it can be bolted (both vertically and horizontally) to a soundstage/mounting bracket.

- Has a switch that allows the speaker to accept either a 110V or 220V source.

- Has built in handles to help carry the speaker, but they don't help with the weight (weighs about 50lbs)

- The manual is not exactly helpful - it is about 4 pages and really doesn't offer much information on how to use the speaker.

Final verdict - There is nothing subtle Pyle Pro 15 inch it is both large and loud - but the great thing is that it provides a high level of functionality (as a backyard speaker, studio monitor, and sound stage speaker) at a very reasonable price. For me, it makes nearly the perfect speaker for backyard movie night - so if you are in market for an inexpensive all-in-one speaker I would highly recommend that you investigate the Pyle Pro 1400 Watt 15 inch Powered Speaker.

"I give this three stars not because of the mics themselves, but the extras. The mics are great, and I recommend them for any gigging drummer, or for use in demo recording.

Now, I know the cables are a ""freebee"" as the microphones alone go for $899, but the cables really are garbage with inferior connectors sound quality. The mic stands are adequate and the best part of the add-on's. Headphone, we'll see. Haven't play with them enough yet.

Overall, a good deal. I didn't expect the extras to be of high quality, so I'm not terribly disappointed. I do wish the cables were of better quality, but you get what you pay for.

As for shipping- very slow via UPS. Everything was in good shape and in working order. However, I must say I'm surprised it made it in one piece. All items were placed into one box that was not strong enough for the weight of the items, plus no padding was added to support the voids created my the various sizes of each item. As a result, the box was crushed and the tape was barely keeping it closed. One would think items totaling $899.00 would be packed with more care.

Finally- if you're looking for great drum mics for a good price, these are the ones, with or without the extras.",3.0

"Super easy to use, and easy to tell when a string is in tune (as opposed to my very old Korg tuner that always seems to read a little sharp or flat no matter how much one fiddles with the tuning key).  I also greatly appreciate that the pitch reference stays where the user sets it, rather than resetting to 440 every time the tuner is powered down like many other tuners.  I thus recommend this tuner for those wanting to experiment with 432 hz tuning (or any non-440 reference pitch).  And it's equally great for good old 440.",5.0

"The worst thing to do is pay too much for guitar strings. It's not going to make a difference. There are guitar strings out there with cobalt cores mined by dwarves from the Mountains of Moria that are like $9-$13 dollars per pack- I've never found them to perform any better than these straight-ahead, relatively cheap strings. I buy more strings and change them fairly regularly. That, in my view, is the way to get the best sound.",5.0
"Great brand, great little stompboxes. Very versatile, very usable, great tones. Offers best of both worlds: tweak knobs like on an analog drive pedal but have the tweak ability of a digital effect. You can actually use the a whole range of distortion engines via the neuro app (20+) so it also includes all kinds of fuzz effects, tube screamer, even klon centaur like sounds. Does it sound like a tube screamer or klon etc? I'm actually tired of this discussion. If you want a tube screamer sound 1:1, best buy one. This thing however, comes very close and it sounds, warm, dynamic, authentic and just really really good. My prognosis Source audio will be huge. Their nemesis delay is one of the best pedals of 2016. Have a number of their pedals and they are all awesome out of the box. One of the most forward thinking companies in the market and the ability to store up 128 presets via the neuro hub in conjunction with their new soleman midi board gives you a full blown multi effect device with full analog tweak ability plus deep editing via neuro app if you add a few of their other also excellent pedals.",5.0

If you want a really good SM58 clone, I would recommend a Behringer XM8500. If you are looking for a back up mic, or you are a cheapo, this will probably satisfy you.

"I wanted to mix the sound between my computer and my consoles so that I could hear my friends on Skype or listen to music while also gaming. After reading the reviews, I figured I wouldn't mind the lowered audio levels in exchange for hearing both of my audio inputs at the same time. Unfortunately that's not the case, as the sound is so low that even with the knobs maxed out that I might as well be listening to a TV from another house rather than directly in my own headset.

I'm sure if I was using speakers, like most of the others folks, that I could crank up the volume in exchange, this product would be pretty great. But I don't use speakers nor do I want to shell out an extensive amount of money for an individual amplifier, so I'm just gonna have to resume looking for an alternative.

"After playing guitar for more than 30 years and using a wide variety of cables, I have settled on Planet Waves as my standard.  In this instance, I chose the right angle cable as part of a 5-cable system (running an effects board with 2 Planet Waves cables going though the effects loop and 2 between the guitar and amp.  The 5th cable is a stereo version for channel switching).  The right angle cables allowed me to effectively route the cables to the pedals on my compact, but crowded, effects board.  This many cables can get really sloppy on the floor, and I decided to go with these cables through 1.25"" expandable braided sleeving (PET) rather than purchasing  a snake custom designed by pedalsnake.com.  One nifty trick I have found helpful is to use different colors of electrical tape on each end of the cable as well as the input to the amps and pedals to make hooking up very simple.  Even if you are a ""straight into the amp"" player, this trick comes in handy to differentiate your cable from others that may look similar.  Overall I have found PlanetWaves cables to be a good combination of value, durability, and tone quality!",5.0

"This is a very well-made gig bag with plenty of storage space for strings, tuner, strap and what-have-you, but it offers only minimum protection for your instrument and you should keep that in mind if this is going to be your ONLY mandolin case.

"I'm not a musician, ie, I don't read music very well. I recently joined a choir (I've got a good ear) and bought this program so that I could copy my tenor parts from the scores we sing and listen to them until I got them down pat. I think this program must be directed toward folks who compose using a MIDI interface because it's definitely NOT for folks who want to use music notation. If you get any more complex than 4/4 time the program inserts funny rests, seemingly at random, which can't be removed. You can enter words with the music but it's difficult to line up the words with their proper notes. It's not very happy with notation or accidentals or time changes or key changes. In short, this may be fine for a MIDI composer but you should look elsewhere if you want to ""compose"" using a staff.",1.0

"These lights are a perfect cheaper alternative event lighting solution.  I bought six of these for an event (still testing out if they are enough to light up half of a gym... might need 10 or so to be safe).  Yes, the outside is plastic with the thin metal frame for hanging, but despite that they don't seem like shady products - pretty straightforward. One of the six lights might need some tweaking because it isn't showing one specific color, but I need to verify that it's the light's fault and not mine.  I used them by standing them up on the floors and pointing them upwards against walls.  They don't seem to overheat (or really heat up much period), and the fans don't sound too loud.  ** Note: I did not try to hook them up to a system so I do not know how good that feature is (I am using them simply as individual lights to stay on throughout the evening).

Things to note:

1) If you want a straight color like blue, green, or red, these lights will not be as bright.  There is a set number of each colored bulb, so unless you use a color like cyan, rose, white, etc. that utilizes more bulbs, you will not have as much light.  So if you're going for those colors, just keep in mind you may need to buy more.

2) The more lighter (white) surfaces you can bounce them off of, the better.  It makes all of the difference when I point them at a lighter colored wall.

3) Each individual light comes with its own remote, but you can use the same remote to control multiple lights.  So if you buy multiple lights, you can just use one remote and save the others for when the battery dies.  Win!

Overall, this product is exactly what I wanted and I am glad that I made this purchase.",5.0

"Took it out of the box, set it on the floor and no matter where/how I angled it, it wobbles. 3 stars,  but, if you look at my picture of the bottom of the item, you'll see there are 5 rubber bumpers screwed in.  So to fix the wobble, you can either;

Take off the middle rubber bumper, leave it off - maybe it won't bow in the middle.
Take off the middle rubber bumper and sand it down a few mm then replace the now 'shorter' rubber bumper.

So when you step/stomp it doesn't wobble, but still supports the middle.  Other than that, its a pretty good pedal board.

The included power supply is very small and comes with an extension so you can daisychain 6 pedals at 1700mA it should be more than enough.  There are no channels for the wires so make sure you toss some velcro wire ties in your new bag.

The bag is just what it is, a bag, there is no padding and the seams seem weak, the handles are stitched all the way down the bag so at least they won't just come off as you carry it.  (See my pictures)

Inexpensive

"I have had spotty luck buying guitars online. This wasn't one of those times. In many instances, I have been compelled to do a fair amount of work on a new guitar so it's as playable as I like. Things from changing the strings and adjusting the neck to far more involved jobs such as fret leveling and crowning. Most guitars need some sort of attention paid to them from the get go. I am lucky that I do not like my strings kissing the tops of the frets; it makes set-up so much less difficult. The Jackson DK2 actually required that I raise the strings ever so slightly. The neck was dead flat, right out of the box, which is the way I like them: with as little relief as possible, preferably none. This can be difficult to accomplish with guitars in this price range, and downright maddening on less expensive instruments. Elsewhere, there is a rather extensive and wordy review I posted for the Kramer Baretta; I won't go into such detail here, because I have spent so little time examining this particular guitar for quirks and weird idiosycracies. Ive played it a bunch and can tell anyone who wants to know that it works. Extremely well.
No, it's not the match of a USA SL 1 Soloist---those cost many times what this guitar cost, and it's easy to know why, at least from my point of view. But the differences are very subtle here, not, perhaps, worth the difference between the $700.00 bolt on DK2, and a three to five thousand dollar USA Select Soloist---not to the average working musician out there. From an off the rack standpoint, this is as good as I've seen. Better by far than my much more expensive ESP Sunburst Tiger.
Rumor has it that there are only 125 of these striped DK2s in existence, and that was a bonus. That, and the fact that good old Sam Ash was selling it for around four hundred dollars less than most.

"Dunlop makes excellent picks. They are really all I use anymore. I generally use the yellow .88s. When I saw that these were the same in black, I had to order them. I love them and I use them, but they are slightly thicker than .88s. They aren't close to .96mms, but they are slightly less bendable than their yellow counterparts. I took off one star for that, because someone might not be very happy with this fact. All in all, great picks. One pack would probably last you for years if we didn't lose picks all the time.",4.0

"I cannot say enough good things about this speaker. I purchased it having read many of the same reviews as you stating that the Bluetooth connecting wasn't working or that it wasn't a high-quality speaker. While that may be true if you're an audiophile, I purchased this speaker to play music at cookouts, tailgates, parties, etc and it's PERFECT. It gets crazy loud, I rarely play past 1/2 volume or else you can't talk near it. Bluetooth works perfectly as well, it pairs with my phone and has never dropped the signal. If for some reason you need to play with a wire to your aux cord, run to your local music store and pickup an adapter. I have tried it out both ways and it works flawlessly. Others have posted complaining about the bass, I'm not sure if you're trying to play dubstep with the bass boosted or what but this speaker handles bass incredibly well. It's not a subwoofer and won't shake the car or make you vibrate but it holds its own in the bass department.
All in all: this is a killer speaker for an unbelievable price. Your search for a DJ speaker should end here, the B112W takes the cake.",5.0

"I was looking for a head phone amp and a EQ for my fun room desk. After checking out many different brands and level of sound manipulation each unit offered,I decided on this EQ. The first unit I received was faulty,so I contacted Behringer Co.to make sure it was`nt anything on my end. I had purchased it through Amazon,so I contacted them for a return. Short time later I was Emailed a RA# and packing slip. The moment Amazon got a tracking # from UPS they mailed out a replacement. I received it in 2 days. Once again,great service from Amazon!! The sound quality is above average for this class of EQ. I believe it is one of the best EQ`s for the price tag! It works well on 16 ohm to 300ohm head phones. I also like the feel and sensitivity of the gain controls-nice! I`m not so sure about the 75hz cut off,how effective it really is. Also the ability to switch between +12db to -12db sensitivity to +6db to -6db is a nice feature. I use the 6db scale for a more accurate setting. The ability to monitor in/out puts is quit accurate. The 9 band freq. unit is suffice for my tastes mainly because I usually only tweak the freq. between 850 and 4khz. Over all I would recommend this EQ to any one.

This pedal offers a low-to-medium gain threshold overdrive tone that is very desirable.  It has a wonderfully large amount of controls for a pedal this cheap, and great tone to boot.  The MojoMojo is great driven straight into a clean amp, when stacked with other overdrives, or when sent into a dirty amp for a heavy tone.

"Background:
After Three years of use it was time to update my review. In the meantime I second guessed my purchase and looked to Fender and Vox modeling amps in the first year. The reason was size and sound since I am using this at home and the neighbours don't like to hear any kind of noise. The other reason was something light for practice and impromptu jams so I needed some volume. I didn't want to have to carry a bunch of gear around ie, Pedals. At any giving time I could be playing blues, rockabilly, punk, jazz, or ambient so having an amp that could be clean, dirty, or aggressive was ideal. I use Single Coil and Humbucker guitars and you have to have the right amp for either so the ID: 30 meet that need.

Pros:
(1) TVP: 6 tube types for emulation (KT88, 6L6, EL84, 6V6, KT66, EL34) While the various valve types are emulated in great detail, produce clearly audible differences and incorporate a degree of power-supply sag  Other amp predecessors have modeled a miked amp and there are newcomers that emulate the electric circuitry of a actual tube i.e. Yamaha's THR series. There are a lot of amp modelers out there but Blackstar has nailed it! I can get the amp to sound like a boutique, Brit, American, or Hi Gain within seconds. It is really easy to figure out. This is truly is a thousand amps in one!

(2) Voicing: Go from clean to aggressive. I favor the Crunch and Clean Bright; other voicings include Clean Warm, Super Crunch, OD1, and OD2. With a combination of TVP and Voicing selections, you will be able to dial in the sound you are looking for regardless of style within a very short time if you know tubes characteristics.

(3) ISF: I lean towards American Equalization (Deep and Bright) but if you want that Midrange rich English sound or something in-between the ISF is a great tool to have.

(4) 128 patch capability with Insider software or the FS-10 Footswitch (Recommended).  This is great if you are playing a set list of covers from different genres.
(5) Emulated input/output for recording to a DAW.

Cons:
(1) Being a all in one amp, no speaker output.

(2) No TRUE effects loop....because it is a all in one amp.  (The headphone output is a little tricky. First it isn't very loud. You also have to turn down the master volume all the way to keep from sound coming from the amp). I also tried to use the (emulated) headphone output through a Ditto X2 looper to feedback in to the Mp3 input but due to low volume output from the headphone output render this pretty much unusable. So if you are looping go with the Blackstar HT Club series for a few $100's more and excellent and affordable choice.

(3) No Mid control on amp but can change it with Insider Software or  set MID or Presence controls on the amp you can set them without software by using Tap and (Treble for Presence) , (ISF for Mid), (Bass for Resonance)

ON-BOARD EFFECTS: are usable but and will save hauling pedals around. However the effects are 4 out of 5. The Delays and Reverbs are very good but the Modulations are so-so.

SOUNDS: Great at low levels for practicing at home and still loud enough for small gigs without losing its headroom at loud volumes. There are a lot of amps that are loud but lack the stage presence... The Blackstar ID delivers in Loudness and Richness. Using Insider you can turn off/on the noise gate with patches. It doesn't take a genius or a degree to get great tone. . While it will not sound 100% like a tube it will get you there better than any modeler amp; due to emulation of power sag and breakup it feels like a tube amp. The cleans are good but if you are a looking for a Fender sound you can get close but are better off buying a Mustang. The clean is as good as the MK series. The crunch is the strong point of this amp. I don't use the OD voicings much since I don't play styles needing to use it but if I were to play metal the voicings are solid and better than the Line 6 or Roland Cube offerings. The Crunch and OD settings have warmth that are missing from Roland or Line 6

BUILD:  The ID: 30 is a solid amp and looks like it will hold up for years to come. After 3 years this amp is still going strong.  Really not much if any signs of wear other than dust. No noticeable noise from the controls. Looks like it will last for years to come. Being a S.S. amp I don't have to worry about changing tubes or handling the amp with kid gloves. The ID: 30 would be a suitable back up and not skip a beat IMO.

Blackstar USB/Insider:  With the use of Blackstar Insider software makes editing patches easy and painless. The BS Insider app will allow you to dial in your sound easier and change the patches in a way that will follow a natural set list. BS Insider also has a metronome, tuner, and virtual tape player to jam along with tracks when connected via USB to a computer. BS Insider is easy to use and you can download it for Mac or Windows for free. It also allows you to upload or download patches that other users have submitted.

THE SKINNY:  I found the ID:30 to be perfect at the time of purchase. There are other companies that are doing now what Blackstar started. Few months before purchasing the ID:30 passed over the Yamaha THR in favor for the Roland Cube Lite for a office-business traveling amp. I found that the Yamaha is a great product and if size is an issue this is your amp due to it can run on batteries but you are limited using it at home, busking, backstage, or a coffee shop. However that THR does not sound anything like the Tube quality of the ID: 30; regardless of volume. You could do better (NOT MUCH) but spend $1000's for rack mount emulators but you can do it and with the ID series you can get 99% and a fraction of the cost.

It was easy to dial in a (tone) Blackstar provides. With time and experimentation find your sweet spot. Metal players will love this amp however, other styles like Jazz, Country, ect., which this amp does well. Until now S.S. amp ever sounded like a tube amp and modeling has come close but never the characteristics tube amps however, Blackstar has accomplished this with all the headroom and sag you would get from any type of tube emulation you choose.

When I think of this amp the comparison to Mesa MK series amps come to mind because of MK versatility. I find that the ID does a better clean than a Mesa MK amp and dialed in right a sound as crunchy or aggressive as a MK amp but without the weight and worries about tube issues. With all the subtleties of a Soldano SLO-100 the ID: 30.

The only pedal you might need is a compressor if you are doing Country or Jazz with single coil guitars.

The ID:30 Rocks. Easy to use the TPV on the amp has 6 tube types, 6 Voicings, and can be adjusted to be any amp you want. The ID: 30 are literally a 1000 amps in one. The Blackstar ID: 30 can be Ioud enough for small venues yet satisfying quiet for bedroom use. It is that simple.",5.0

"As a flutist of 11 years, I would like to give my two cents on this product. I have had experience with these fluffy ""pad-savers"" in my beginning years.

The flute is a delicate instrument. Though it is made of metal, the pads hidden underneath each key are precious and must be taken good care of to retain its optimal playing ability. Beginning instruments take a lot of abuse, beginning with products such as these. The ""fluff"" can come undone, irritating the pads as well as leaving excess moisture within the instrument as they do not have a high water retention abilities. It is critical that one thoroughly removes condensation from the flute.

Secondly, this product is usually used to not only ""remove condensation,"" but also to be stuffed and stored in the body of the instrument while in the case. This allows the condensation to sit for hours until the player takes the pad-savers out again to play. Unfortunately, the pads will soak up moisture over time and become sticky. This leads to repairs, reduced tone quality, and overall diminished quality of playing.

Please, to clean the flute properly, use a cloth strung through a stick or use a ""flute flag"". It is critical that what we flutists use to clean our instruments does not sit in our instrument after use. Please do not stuff your instrument with anything while it sits in the case.",2.0

The wood and finish is beautiful, the tone is sweet, it feels good in the hands, but it needs the owner's extra practice to get the extra benefits of good reliable sound. I'm keeping mine forever, by the way, and I grab it at least once a day to tootle with, and I think I'll eventually learn it well enough to help it sound good, when I'll realize it's a 5 star.",4.0

"Let's face it, this turntable is not going to be sufficient for real Audiophiles. This turntable is for the casual music fan who just wants to be able to play those old LP's and 45's again, and maybe digitize them.

This turntable looks fabulous. It has kind of a vintage quality to it. But it's very light weight, so I have to wonder how durable or well made it is. The speakers are a joke. Just don't bother. Very ""tinny."" Though, for my nephew, he thought this was a plus, because ""that's the sound I expect to hear from old records."" For me, it's unacceptable. The sound is much better when connected to decent speakers, so, I am happy with that.

I do wish that it came with a dust cover. Why wouldn't it have a dust cover? If you have an enclosed cabinet to put this in, it's fine, but if you don't, expect lots of dust to get into the system and possibly harm it.

I really appreciate that this player has a 78 speed. So many don't! And really, the very old recordings that most people might want to digitize are 78's. Most recordings that were available on LP or 45 have already been digitized and are available on Amazon or iTunes or wherever. Honestly, I'm not really sure why you'd digitize from a vinyl record unless the recording you have is really rare.

As far as the digitizing is concerned, the software seems simple to use, and does work fairly well.

If you're a casual music fan with a small, rare music collection that you need to digitize and want a simple solution, this is the turntable to get. If you are a hard-core vinyl fan, there are better turntables out there...you may want to keep looking.",3.0

"This is a very good harmonica for the price.  My daughter is a musician and I thought I'd get this for her just to have something different to play around with as she plays several other instruments.

It's not cheaply made at all.  It also has really good sound which is what is drawing her in to it.  She has basically been looking online for information on how to learn to play the harmonica and has had some success on YouTube.  She told me that the thing she likes best about it is that it is so small she can pack it in her backpack or purse and carry it around with her so she can practice and play it whenever she has spare time.  The thing is, it takes awhile to get good at playing it, however, it actually sounds nice even when she's just playing around with it.  I'm very glad I bought this for her.",5.0
"Violin has a beautiful, resonant tone.  It is more mellow than the previous 1/8 size we had.  The coloring and finish is rich, accented by the rosewood tailpiece, tuners, and chin rest.

Overall, as a entire outfit, the price of this violin was a superb value.  I did go ahead and upgrade the fine tuners with Wittner Stable-style tuners for all four strings, as they are much easier to deal with for tuning, and it only comes with the single E-string fine tuner.  That being said, the main tuning pegs are smooth and stable (I didn't have to apply peg dope at all to make them work right).

"After hearing about the HDSS standard from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharp-i-Elegance-Music-System-for-iPod-and-MP3-Players-High-Gloss-Red-Black/dp/B0024NL3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharp i-Elegance Music System for iPod and MP3 Players (High Gloss Red/Black)</a>&nbsp;I did some research and found the creators of HDSS are actually TBI and they sell their own line of HD speakers.  I was impressed by the bass produced by the Sharp iPod dock (it has a port on those small speakers to produce bass!) so I decided to pick up a pair of Diamonds via a sale  on the TBI site and I am really impressed.

I read these work via heat sink technology...TBI have created a low pressure system inside the enclosure to absorb the 'bad' energy from the speaker which usually creates resonance and distortion.  These speakers have none of the bad and produce the clearest, most natural sounds at even the lowest volumes.

Don't be tricked by the 25w label either, because of this passive heat sink, these speakers do NOT need a lot of energy to create sound the high end guys wish they could get from $10,000 speakers.

In an industry full of snake oil and marketing gimmicks, its refreshing to see a new approach with real science behind it.  Check out the impulse response measurements on their site here:

[...]

I ended being so impressed, I eventually upgraded to the Diamond II's for my music room and used these 2 speakers to replace my 6.1 surround sound on my home theater after getting one of their subs - the Magellan.  Fastest sub I've ever heard, but I'll save that review for later...for now, all I can say is I couldn't be happier with my TBI speakers and am so glad I found them!",5.0

Tempo is easy to set and even though the music is sped up or slowed down, it remains in pitch.

Obviously, I am very happy and use the MPBT1 trainer every day.

"This is an amazing pickup. If you are a cellist who is performing in non-traditional venues, then you should definitely pick this up. The pre-amp is already built into the device, so all you need is a 1/4"" cable (found at most electronic stores), and an amplifier. It picks up the the cello's natural sound beautifully without distortion or feedback of any kind.

It comes with really basic instructions on how to install it.  FYI: (Do not remove the black rubber band that is on the wire. This is to provide the right amount of slack between the inducer and the mounting on the tailpiece.)  I suggest lying your cello on its back on a bed. Then you want to loosen the fine tuner pegs on all the strings, and loosen the A and D strings down one or two octaves. Then you should take the C and G strings off.  Lift up the foot of the bridge on the CG side and place the copper inducer underneath, with the ridge part towards the tailpiece. Make sure it lines up neatly with the sides of your bridge, and it's okay if it sticks out a little towards the middle of the bridge.  Attach the cylindrical part to your tailpiece by wrapping the velcro around it. I play a 3/4 size cello, and it falls about an inch and a half up from the bottom of the tailpiece. Check to make sure that the wire between the inducer is situated behind the fine tuners and the back of the tailpiece. (You can also permanently attach it to the tailpiece, but you don't want to do that if you're using a rental like I am).  Once it's installed, put your C and G strings back on, tune up your cello, and get ready to be amplified!",5.0

"I am trying to find a good voice microphone for short voice over presentations, YouTube videos, and Podcasts. I own an AKG P120 and it is very good, but I wanted to try a non-phantom-powered free energy dynamic microphone. The 8500 has stellar reviews. I was worried about it being too shrill, and bright sounding because some said it runs ""hot"" and has a lot of presence boost, compared to the Shure microphones. My first impression is that it's very focused in the lows and mids, only. It has no treble whatsoever, just a lot of mids and low mids.

The low mids seem to be boosted as much or more than the upper mids, so it doesn't sound anything like it's voltage output vs. frequency range graph included in the instructions, which shows only a very large upper mid and treble range boost. I cannot hear any treble boost at all.

I am using a Scarlett Focusrite and I have tested this microphone with the gain maxed out on the Scarlett. With the gain at level 10, it does not have any line noise or aberrations of any kind, it has a silent noise floor, silent. Even when you then amplify the recorded sound using Audacity sound editor, after recording with the gain at level +10, you cannot hear any aberrations, feed back, or white noise. At least none that I've noticed. I have only just tested it for an hour or so.

Overall the sound is a little muffled and warm sounding without any harshness or bad upper range frequencies. However, if you speak a little further away, it makes it sound a lot more neutral, and clear, so speaking very close into the microphone isn't ideal with this microphone unless you can just use your EQ and dial down a little bit less bass. Once I edited the sound file using Audacity and did a ""low cut"" removing some of the bass, it sounded really good, and very natural, although speaking further away from the microphone, fixes excessive bass. All microphones have excessive bass if you are too close.

This microphone sounds totally muted in the treble region, there is no brightness, and no sharpness to the sound, it's a very mid range and low mid range heavy sound, that will need a slight bit of EQ adjustment if you are needing high frequency sound. But overall, I'd say that the sound is very natural, it does not add the really sharp fake shrill sound to the top edge of the treble region like I often hear in all the normal ""condenser"" microphone videos online. With the 8500, I would say that it lacks clarity and definition, while sounding more accurate, and gentle. Our voices are not meant to sound machine-like and overly sharp, like they sound in many YouTube video interviews using cheap microphones or improper EQ settings.

Voices should sound like they are produced by a Human, not a machine. The 8500 nearly has a perfect pitch for recording spoken words. It doesn't add any upper end ""sparkle"" but it does add a bit of bass boost and makes your voice deeper. Keep in mind that this is a new microphone, so I am giving a totally subjective review based on limited testing.

I would say that the 8500 blocks out background noise extremely well, you cannot hear anything in the background. It does not pick up the cat in the background or the cars going by outside.

This is an excellent microphone. For the price, it's very natural and has a good sound. It requires a tremendous amount of gain, which is normal for all non-powered microphones, although it does not have any white noise, or line noise, and the handling noise is very low. I tried banging the microphone around and it produces very muted noises, which indicates good vibration isolation.

For my first impression, the XM8500 would work best for people who do not have deep voices, unless they simply use an EQ and dial down a little bit of the bass. I think it would probably be an amazing microphone for anyone who has a neutral sounding or slightly higher pitched voice. If you speak further away it sounds a lot more natural, and the mids aren't as muffled by the bass. Using an EQ, I was able to remove the bass, while retaining the clarity and natural sound to the voice.

My AKG P120 is more forgiving for the bass ""proximity effect"" when speaking very close into it, but it's also more sensitive overall and picks up all the high frequency sounds coming from your mouth, from the chair you're sitting in, or from the cat across the room. The AKG P120 is a powered microphone, so it has more gain. If you turn the gain down, it picks up very little background noise, and you cannot hear a car go by outside.

The AKG P120 is slightly thin. It will smooth the rough edges of your voice, leaving it sounding more clear and precise than you actually are. The Behringer Ultravoice XM8500 does not clarify your voice. If you are rough sounding, it will muddy the sound. You have to speak clearly. If you have a rough deep voice, I would not recommend the 8500, but I would recommend the AKG P120. In comparison, the AKG P120 can miraculously remove all hoarseness and roughness coming from your vocal cords, so it records more clear than it should. The 8500 records low bass hoarseness in your voice accurately and doesn't smooth it away. I was trying to record today with a hoarse voice and the 8500 doesn't help to clarify my rough voice today. However, for light and thin voices, the 8500 would be magic.

I'm going to do some more tests, because my voice is dry today and it's not as clear as normal, so I don't have adequate tests to give a final conclusion. The 8500 seems very good for the price, and the only downside is that it's a dynamic non-powered microphone, so it is not as sensitive as the phantom powered ""condenser"" microphones. But this isn't a disadvantage, it's just an attribute of dynamic microphones.

Note: I also hooked up an impedance matching cable to test this out, by adapting this microphone to plug straight into my small hand held Sony digital recorder. The digital recorder has never worked better! Wow! I was shocked at how clear, and how loud the 8500 was, plugged into an XLR to 1/8"" adapter cable, without any preamp or anything. So if you are using a DSLR camera, video camera or other recording device that accepts a 1/8"" microphone input cable, this Behringer 8500 will work wonders if you just purchase this impedance matching cable: http://amzn.to/2hqI4By

I had the 8500 plugged directly into my hand held digital recorder using the onboard 1/8"" port on the recorder, and it had tons of gain, and very clear signal. I tired the same thing on my computer on the front panel microphone input but that didn't work good at all, it was too quiet, and too much noise. But I haven't tried this using the ports on the back of the computer, or into a real sound card. I will do more tests and report back.",5.0

I ordered second (different) bowl that I like better, its not as pretty, but makes a tri-tone (if thats even a word), a combination of E, F, and G. Lovely to my ears.
Keep in mind each bowl is individually made, and like any bell, will have an individual sound/tone. Two of these identical bowls, side by side, will most likely have different sound variations.
Also, each persons ears will receive the tones differently into their ears/brains.

"The most common method for check neck relief while making truss rod adjustments is to fret the string at the first and last frets and measure the gap between the bottom of the string and the 8th fret with a feeler gauge.  Although this most certainly works, it is difficult to get a wide feeler gauge at the correct angle on a thin, curved fret to make sure you are measuring properly.  This tool takes the guess work out of making this measurement.  You can now use the feeler gauge between the straight edge and the flat surface of the fret board to measure the relief at any fret.  Since the frets themselves are out of the equation, it takes out the error of an individual fret being high or low.

I've used this to set the neck relief on my Schecter C-6 Deluxe (25.5"" scale) and my Epiphone Les Paul Standard (24.75"" scale) and it worked great for both.  The 25.5"" scale side also fits my Ibanez acoustic, so I look forward to tweaking that guitar as well.",5.0

The only problem with the ukulele is that you have to constantly tune it after you're done playing it and want to play it again later but other than that the songs that I tried on this like ""Falling in Love with You"" ~ Elvis Presley and ""Someone to Lava"" ~ Disney, sounded extremely similar to the actual songs.

"Let me start off by saying I did NOT purchase these speakers through Amazon, but through a different vendor.

With that out of the way, all I can say is these speakers sound and perform amazingly.  As a mobile DJ, I'm always looking to upgrade my equipment, and it was time for me to graduate from my current league of speakers and enter the pros.

The EKX line of EV speakers is their mid/pro level speakers.  The ZLX and ELX being the entry and mid ranges (respectively).  The ETX are their Pro level.  You will not think of these as mere mid-range level speakers at all.  I'll break the reasons down below:

Construction/Aesthetics
When you take the speakers out of the box, they scream craftsmanship.  They are indeed heavier than your run of the mill plastic-bodied PA Speakers, as they should, as they are wood enclosures.  There is no flex or wobble in these speakers.  The grills are machined perfectly and just look very modern and top tiered.  They are covered with what EV calls: EV Coat.  It's pretty much the same type of material as a spray-on bed-liner.  I have had the opportunity to use these at a gig that I had to drive 6 hours to get to, in an SUV full of lighting equipment and flight cases.  Even with equipment leaning on them and bouncing into them, the speakers stayed blemish and dent free.  I DO need to get covers though, and I will.

SOUND
Of course, this is what every performer, musician, DJ and Club Owner cares about.  These speakers sound INCREDIBLE.  While I haven't compared these to EV's top of the line ETX speakers, these pretty much top all the other speakers I spent months and months researching, these being JBL, Mackie and Yamaha.  They hold up well to even QSC's, but at a lower price point.

I'm not going to go into technical specs and lingo, like SPL, Watts, Hz and KHz.  I'm going to speak in laymen terms.  I bought these speakers because my ""roadie"" moved out of town and I'm left with hauling equipment to gigs by myself. I previously had 12 inch tops and 2 15 inch subs.  Combined, that system weighed about 270 pounds.  The subs alone weighed 90+ pounds.  Too much weight and too awkward for me to move around by myself, even with my folding, rolling cart.  I was at a formal where the DJ had two 12 inch EV Elx's and they sounded wonderful. So after some research (and 2nd hand testimony from a LOT of DJ's) I found that these 15 inch tops would have sufficient bottom-end (bass) for the events I do.  I sold my other speakers and bought these.  In short, I bought these so I could cut down on bringing 4 speakers with me, while retaining a full rich sound.  These do that.  The highs and mids are great.  I will say, if using a DJ controller or mixer, you'll have to cut quite a bit of top-end down some, as it is LOUD.  The bass is deep, punchy and well rounded.  The bass on these speakers is ALMOST as powerful as the bass on my two entry level SUBS!  I can already tell, as a bass-head, I'll probably be purchasing one or two of EV's EKX subs... The wooden cabinets definitively make the difference here, for bottom end sound.  I keep the gains on 0db and use my DJ controller for all sound related modifications and, man-o-man, these speakers will EASILY fill a venue for 200 people.

I haven't used the much talked about DSP settings much, but for my needs, I keep the gains on 0db and put the DSP to Club and that's all that is needed, for me.

SIZE
As I mentioned before, these speakers have replaced two 12 inch tops and two 15 inch subs... Their wonderfully rich sound does come at a cost.  The speakers are fairly large and heavy.  Weight-wise, I believe they are just about 42lbs or so.  That being 17lbs heavier (each) than my previous PA speakers, BUT, about 50lbs lighter (each) than my previous subs.  Thankfully, they have 2 handles on them (like on sub boxes).  Both of these are on opposite sides of the enclosure.  I would have loved to have an additional handle on the top, like on their entry to mid-level speakers, but I make due with them.  It's better than having only one handle like on my other speakers.

I have attached two pics to give the speakers some sort of scale.  The first pic is in my practice area where I put together mixes and then listen to them on my couch.  The second pic is at a wedding I did, where the speakers were slightly lower than my 10 foot lighting truss.  As you'll see, they are large speakers, but not overly so.

All this is to say that these speakers look great and sound SUPERB!  Yes they are pricey at $900 a piece or $1800 for the pair, but they are worth it.  Like the saying goes: you get what you pay for.  I intend to use these until they fall apart!",5.0

I'm wondering if connecting the external mic / headset doesn't play well with some of the other hardware in the phone ... maybe it thinks it's some kind of hardware switch, like on the EarPods.

"I am a professional musician who actively uses USB & Firewire interfaces for recording live instruments.

I got the UX2 as a part of a bundle for my education and used it for around a half of a year before finally dismissing it.

The audio quality is fine, but almost everything else is an issue. For one: The size. This interface does not need to be as huge as it is, and a lot of its size comes from the superfluous fake VU meters on the front. They don't add anything except bulk. The humongous knobs aren't practical either, and I actually had some noise from them almost immediately after getting the UX2.

The absolute worst part, though: The drivers and implementation with software. You HAVE to use their proprietary programs in order for the UX2 to even be recognized, it is TERRIBLE. You can't just simply go into a program like Logic (or Garage Band) and start using it, you have to use their programs like Gearbox and Monkey to activate it and tell it what inputs you're using. Absolutely terrible, interfaces should not have you jumping through hoops just to use it.

Again, I do not recommend this product and would instead steer you towards the Focusrite brand of USB interfaces before the UX2.",2.0

I brought my usual cable set up just in case the audio 2000 system did not work. But it worked perfectly.

I have the transmitter about 10 feet away from me. No weird noises, no drops.

As noted in other reviews, the equipment comes in a nice hard case. I would probably have used it but I decided to mount the transmitter on a pedal board with my Shure wireless guitar unit.

Everything seems pretty solid on the unit. I will say that the body pack does not seem quite as solid as the Shure guitar pack. But not by much

I have only used it once. If I have any negative experience, I'll update this review.

"My son loves this tuner, he is 15 but has been in band for 3 years now.  He is in pep, symphonic, and Jazz band and is going to New Orleans to play in a concert this summer.  The back ground is to let you know he is a serious player and wants his instruments to be in tune exactly.  He uses this on Trombone and Tuba.",5.0

"I have been a Regular Slinky user for the last 16 years.  I have tried many others, but I have always reverted to that size and brand for their tone and feel.  The downfall of those strings is that they don't sound great for very long.  I perform weekly and I try to get at least a month of use out of a set of strings, although, the Slinky's that I used to use have a two week window until they start to sound dead.  After trying these from GHS, not only does the size feel better, but the strings will put up with use for about a month until the tone goes south.  No other strings will feel or sound right to me ever again, which is fine by me if they continue to make these strings for a long time.",5.0

I'm new to the guitar and I'm just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best (for me) with different guitars and different effects. I like these for my acoustic Ibanez dreadnaught. The pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the D'addario strings. They are comfortable and I like the feel in my hand. The mediums suit me. Maybe it is all personal taste but I think they are worth buying. Amazon pricing is great. The picks feel great and I'm having a good time.,5.0

"Not for me. Picked these up for electric bass hoping for a smoother tone for some styles. While the sound of pick attack is absent when using these (which is what I had hoped for) there was a downside of them being rather difficult to play with.

For starters, 5.0 turns out to be much thicker than I expected. Then again. maybe I should have expected 5.0 to be quite thick. The other downside, which I feel is the worst part, is that the pick almost feels like it grabs the strings, making steady/quicker playing impossible for me. This might be a side effect of these not being intended for use with metal strings (which is why I gave 3 stars instead of less, as I don't want the maker to get a damaged reputation in case my use of these picks is not what it was designed for).

I have read some reviews that they were great for ukelele. Maybe consider them if you play something with nylon strings.",3.0
"A month in & works great.  Yes it has its flaws but if you want to pay hundreds for a certified DVR go right ahead.  Adding a memory stick no problem just have to follow instructions on what type to buy.  Recording while not as simple as could be, is not difficult again if you follow along.  Converter box must stay on for any scheduling to take place because as others have mentioned it has no sleep timer.  One quirk that got me was the scan and delete of unwanted channels... ""they come back!""  A work around however which I stumbled upon is to ""select SKIP"" in the menu under EDIT CHANNELS and then you will be able to scroll thru only the channels you want.  Picture is crisp, no lip sync issues thus far as some have reported and the remote works good for me unlike a few who said the thing must be directed directly at the box.  Good tuner btw, I was able to pull in 132 channels overall (which is normal for my area) however keep in mind more than 70% of them are junk so there's that.  Time will tell how this box stands up in the long run but so far, so good.",5.0

"I originally planned on buying a Gibson Les Paul but when I saw this Epiphone LP, I fell in love. Turned out to be a great decision. Here's why:

-SOUND-
Incredible sound for a sub-$500 guitar! Unless you're a guitar expert, you wouldn't know this isn't a Gibson LP.

-FIT & FINISH-
This guitar is very well made. It showed up two days after I ordered it and has no blemishes or noticeable factory defects. The pictures don't do this guitar justice. The blue is metallic and looks amazing in person! This color is uncommon so I'm glad my LP looks somewhat unique.

-PLAYABILITY-
I'm not a pro so I'm not perfectly qualified to comment technical aspects but this guitar just feels right in my hands. I'm used to playing an acoustic so this solid body seems a little heavier than I'm used to. Sitting down, this thing feels at home on my lap.

-SET UP-
It arrived set up and ready to play. Didn't even need my tuner. Just plug into an amp (or 360/PS3 for Rocksmith) and you're good to go. I suggest picking up a leather strap if you're going to be standing for long periods due to the weight.

-RECOMMENDATION-
I'm glad I only spent a few hundred (Epiphone) instead of plunking down almost four digits (Gibson) for an LP Studio. This is a good candidate for anyone's first Les Paul. Buy without hesitation!",5.0
it looks really nice in actual and very easy to use. i love how the sound does not distort.,5.0

"The seller got these to me way sooner than expected i highly recommend the seller!!! The cables were packaged neatly and professional. The sound amazing compared to my old cables. I say amazing because they let the sound through without adding noise or creating signal loss. They are very expensive compared to average cables but about the same price as other high end cables. If you really want something that is studio quality as the name suggest, then I would recommend these. If you do not mind a slight amount of signal loss or very slight noise with several connected pedals then the regular cables will do just fine. i highly recommend these cables for your audio needs!",5.0
"I gave it five stars because it is what it is. A great little pedal that won't break the bank. Great effects, long battery life, best interface I have seen on anything this size, and super easy to use. Yes it is missing some features but as most people have attested to they are not needed anyway. I have used this pedal to gig with and it worked flawlessly. Clear and clean when used by itself in front of an amp. The effects are awesome with or without tweaking. As usual you have to adjust your amp to account for the gain and EQ things a bit depending on your setup. This unit has built in compression and a noise gate. That being said it does not like to play with other pedals. That's where the noise and distortion inevitably comes in. If I am using the looper with my existing pedal board I simply bypass the effects. The headphone out makes silent practice possible and the usb in allows for easy updates. This has all trappings of a large multi-effects pedal and looper in a compact unit priced at a measly $49.99. If you need more the pay more. All I can say is Zoom did it again! This is not only a keeper I already want a backup.",5.0

I recently had problems with the cable that connects Jam to my laptop (could have been my son's fault). Regardless, when I wrote to Apogee to learn more about the issue they sent me a replacement before I even had to ask.  I really appreciated that.  Highly recommend getting this.",5.0

"I grew up taking piano lessons. I really wish The One Smart Piano was around when I was learning. The integration of the app with the keyboard is truly the best system I have seen and really makes it easy to learn how to play. This keyboard lights up as you move through the music and actually waits until you hit the right key before you move on. The app also allows for different styles of learning; one is a game where you play the notes (think guitar hero with the keyboard). Another way to learn is with more traditional sheet music. With the app, you can also select the level and adjust the speed of songs. The one downside to this keyboard is that it is only 61 keys, so not the full 88-keys of a piano. 61 keys is still great for learning and practicing (and the shorter keyboard makes it a bit more portable for storing). I would recommend it for levels from beginner to intermediate for all ages. I am writing this review as part of a contest.",5.0
"Great sounding pedal, very close to the old Echoplex. Colors the sound a bit but that's the point if you are looking for the old EP3 sound. Has the option to leave the pre-amp stage engaged for that little extra-drive in your signal chain. Very happy with this pedal.",5.0
I must say I was blown away by this equalizer from Behringer made in Germany. Not only is it cheaper than most run-of-the-mill American made equalizers but the sound quality is far superior. Now I'm not a DJ or a musician so you folks who fit that criteria don't get all huffy puffy now just because of what I said above. There is a lot of quality equipment made in American for just that but for the home stereo enthusiast like me this equalizer really fits the bill!,5.0

"I got my 5135 'vette for Christmas and absolutly love it. The quality is excellent considering I have paid twice the price of these for other guitars and was never as impressed. I must have lucked out, mine  stays in tune, even using the Bigsby (lightly of course, just enough to add shimmer. These were never made to dive bomb) I was researching Compton bridges ( they work great on 5120 jazz boxes) and TV Jones but after playing this for hours now, I'm changing nothing! Seriously, that good ( at least to my ears). I am still finding really sweet sounds out of this from clean to full on distortion. Did I mention comfortable? Light? Great neck and action out of the box? Well its all of that. Don't ponder just buy it. You will be grinning from ear to ear :)",5.0

These sticks are amazing.  Besides the fact that they are high quality and balanced sticks that you can actually play with the graphics are insane!  It seems that the graphics are actually painted directly on the stick.  There is no label or seam or anything.  I have tried several other manufacturers and they don't come close to this quality.

"I got this with a gift card for my birthday. I had wanted one for quite some time.  I researched various Singing Bowls on Amazon and this one sounded just right.  It arrived in a timely manner and I was busy with stuff and didn't open it till about 3 weeks after I bought it.  I didn't really look at it but did take the mallet and hit it against the bowl and it didn't sound like it had in the video.  I tried it again and just didn't like it. I knew I needed to return it.  I ended up forgetting about it till recently and then realized I could return it so I decided to try to sell it online.  I took it out to take pictures and noticed something I hadn''t noticed before, it looks like it has been used. It has black spots on the outside and in the inside it has marks.

"These drums look terrific and are not terrible to set up if you're handy.  They sound pretty good, considering they're a starter kit.  They are a ""real"" drum set, not a toy.  My 5 year old was the right height for this set; I'd imagine they'd be ok for 4-7 year olds.  We replaced the sticks with regular-sized Firth sticks; the included ones were so short he sometimes banged his fingers on the drum.  After only 5 months, however, the snare top has ripped and been repaired, the cymbals are beaten all to heck, and the bass drum and high hat pedals have come off and put back on many times.  This is all from what I'd consider light/regular use by a motivated learner--he practices hard about 30 minutes a day.  I don't regret buying this set, especially since it was for a 5 year old who I wasn't sure would take to drums, but I am a little dismayed to forsee replacing the whole thing in less than a year.",4.0

"I'll begin by stating that I am only an intermediate player, but I have tried the following harps:
Hohner => Golden Melody, Big River, Special 20, Marine Band, Pro Harp, Blues Harp.
Lee Oskar => major diatonic, natural minor diatoinic, and harmonic minor diatonic.
Seydel => 1847 Silver, Solo Blues Session.
Suzuki => Promaster, Bluesmaster, Fire Breath.
For playability the best harps are all of the Suzuki's with the Seydel's coming in a close second. The loudest harp is the 1847 Silver. The best tone for that Chicago blues sound is the Marine Band. The hardest to play are the Marine Band and the Lee Oskars as they seem leaky and the Marine Band quality is just down right dreadful at times (and at other times good). My favorite harmonica is now the Fire Breath. The wood comb is sealed so it does not swell up like a Marine Band will when you tongue block which makes the holes distorted or misshapen. It has a less bright tone than the Promaster with its all aluminum comb and feels very substantial in the hands. Oh, and it bends with ease (as do all of the Suzuki's). It is a bit more money than any of the Hohners listed, but I'll pay the difference to get a quality harp that enhances my ability with ease of play. I am in the process of buying all 12 keys of the Fire Breath. I really like the looks of the black cover plates contrasting the dark rosewood comb as well. I guess it was love at first bite. :-)",5.0
"These pickups sound great but are very delicate and easily damaged when installing or doing anything with them.  I have had one fail when my screw driver grazed the pickup.  I bought a replacement and the second pickup is beginning to act up, I'm not too certain why.  But they look and sound great when they are working.  I would think twice about buying the pair because it isn't easy buying the singles if one fails because Fender does not always make the singles available.",4.0

"Well I am no expert on tube rolling, since I've only had a tube amp for 3 months. But after 2 months of use with these I have found them to be a pleasant surprise for being a current production set of tubes. Initially they took about 60-80 hrs of burn in to reach an enjoyable quality of sound, which I just left my amp on playing music without any headphones plugged in whenever I was home and not listening to music (didn't wanna burn the house down!). I have a Schiit Lyr 2 and I think they sound much better than the stock tubes, but note, any sound related opinions should be regarded as subjective. I also think that for some songs and genres, like Tame Impala, with a heavy vintage effects production, they sound better than my Holland made bugle boys from the early 60's. I would say the Telefunkens offer a clear type of sound that work to produce an accurate image of what the artist had in mind. Mind you, at first they were a bit hollow sounding and it really bothered me, like watching a blu-ray movie but with mono audio. I don't know how well these tubes are matched but the volume and audio quality do not seem diminished in any way.

Overall, I would recommend these because I find these in my amp more often than my other sets, but take my review lightly as I have little experience with in the tube rolling business.",5.0

Packaging was good.  Got all excited when I saw the case, which appeared to be nice, opened the case being optimistic and excited that the product would be equally as good, then BOOMB! the bomb dropped!!  Absolute garbage.

Let me first start by saying the finish looks like some guy spray painted it in his garage and used a butter knife to carve out the cutouts. Not sure which one he did first. The next big disappointment and really the deal breaker was the tuning knobs.  They are press fit and the pegs don't stay in their mating receptacles making tuning impossible.  This can be construed as a defect but really is a matter of just a real bad, cheap design, construction and craftsmanship.

I've seen some toy violins at the dollar tree that are better made.

Don't waste your time.  Invest more in something with better quality.  I've certainly learned my lesson.

"For the very cheap price that you pay for this boom arm, you'd expect something that barely works and breaks quick. Thankfully, this arm gives you way more quality than you pay for. It has served extremely useful for my recording purposes and has yet to fail me.

"I wrote a previous great review on this product, so I need to update buyers about this product.
This machine worked great for about 4 mos. Now, the screen turns blue, the lyrics cut out, the mic sound is extremely low and the music garbles. I have tested the mic, speakers, receiver and tv. It is not the other components. We tried several different cd's and it happens on all of them. I wrote the retailer for help, but it is past the return date so they won't help me. The manufacturer warranty is for 1 year, but I have to pay for shipping to and from the VocoPro center and insurance, which cost about what I paid for the machine! Furthermore, they are not responsible for damage that may happen during shipping. I am very dissatisfied. 4 months is what I got out of the machine, that is it!!! FYI... the machine sat in the same place from the time I installed it to when it broke. We take extremely good care of our stuff so I know it is a manufacturing issue, and not some irresponsible screw-up on our part. I am very sad and miss my karaoke. What a waste of hard earned money :(",1.0

"I bought this little guy yesterday at a ""box store"" type guitar shop who I'll leave nameless.  My friend and I both are life long musicians, and thought it would be fun to pick up a couple of Ukes to have a little ukulele band to busk and do gig with.  My friend got it for me as a present.  It was $39.  Got it home and once the strings stretched and it stayed in tune...fell.  in.  love!!!

This has such a bright little sound, is so easy to play, and is reasonably attractive to boot!  Now, 5 stars is a really high rating, but the thing is for $39 I do not think you could possibly get a better instrument.  We played our Uke's for 6 hours straight and already have a small set list to do some busking with.

One of the things I HATE about Amazon ratings is the typical ""I got this in the mail and such and such was broken"".  People, obviously ANYTHING that comes in the main has the chance of being broken IN THE MAIL...that shouldn't reflect rating of the product!!!!  As for cosmetic flaws...I didn't find any myself, but I laughed when I heard the complaints of a so called ""guitar builder and musician"" and the laundry list of cosmetic things he found wrong with it.  Really, sir, do you expect a hand crafted Gibson quality instrument for $39?!?  If so, you are clearly mad.

In summary, I feel that if you are even remotely interested in Ukulele...this is a no lose purchase!",5.0

"This pedal provides bass, mid and treble controls, something I needed because my Bugera 5w tube amp only has a generic tone control. In addition, it provides what is called a voicing control, which just gives you some more tonal options, and a gain boost. This is a very useful pedal for me. As to providing you with the tone of an Vox AC30 amp, I can't speak to that. I've never used an AC30.

Amended Review: I had to return the first pedal because it stopped working after a couple of months. But I liked the pedal so much, I received another. But this pedal has also quit working after just a few months, and it has not been used very much. I am extremely disappointed in Joyo's quality control and I cannot recommend their pedals.",1.0

"It almost pains me to give this item 3 stars, because when it works it is incredible. However, 90% of the time, it does not. Even when I am within 3 feet of the speaker the music cuts in and out, as if it is out of range. I have tried every trick in the book in order to get the connection between the speaker and my phone to be strong, and nothing has prevailed. It is constantly going in and out unless I leave my phone right next to it. For $200 i definitely would have expected and liked more than that. Again, I did not wish to give this 3 stars, in fact, my conflicting feelings about it is what kept me from giving it 2 stars. When it works it is phenomenal, the base and the clarity is unique and so gratifying. But, I would like to get them same result without having to have my phone completely stationary and right next to the speaker. I am very disappointing.

"I spent several months researching this purchase.  Almost everywhere that offered advice about maintaining records said that an RCM is an essential part of being an analog enthusiast.  My collection is relatively small - probably about 25 LPs altogether, and my wishlist will probably never put that number anywhere north of 60, so while I had my eye on the VPI 16.5, I just couldn't bring myself to buy an RCM that was more expensive than my entire collection put together.  All of the reviews of the Record Doctor V claimed adamantly that in all the ways that matter, it's exactly the same as the Nitty Gritty RCMs, just manually operated.

Almost all of my LPs came from second-hand stores, and some of them were truly dirty.  The whole reason I bought them was for the larger album art - that is until I got my turntable and got to experience the difference directly.  But I digress.

Some of my LPs were so dirty that I couldn't bring myself to attempt to play them until after running them through the Record Doctor, so for the first few albums, I didn't really have a before and after listen.  When I started cleaning records I had already heard, however, I was very disappointed to discover that they were actually noisier after being cleaned than beforehand.

I very carefully followed the instructions that came with the machine, and the instructional video that Audio Advisor put up on YouTube, but for some reason the records come out sounding worse.  I made sure the records were completely dry before trying to play them - even allowing them to ""air out"" for 30 minutes or so after cleaning.  I tried doing a ""rinse"" with distilled water after using the Record Doctor cleaning solution to remove any remaining ""surfactant"", but it hasn't helped.  I'm afraid that I've permanently ruined at least one extremely rare picture disk with this machine.

It's entirely possible that I'm doing something wrong, but I can't work out what it might be, and it seems to me if it's that easy to screw up a record with this machine, there ought to be some very stern warnings included with the instructions.

Feel free to dogpile with any suggestions.

UPDATE:
I spent some time on the phone with Audio Advisor to see if there was anything I could do to improve the situation.  They were very knowledgable and helpful, but none of their suggestions made any difference, and in the end I returned it for a refund.  As insane as the price tag is for a VPI 16.5, I'm planning on picking one up as a replacement in the near future.

With as picky as vinyl lovers are I doubt there is a fundamental design flaw with the Record Doctor V or it would not get so many good reviews, and with as much troubleshooting as I went through, I don't believe I was doing anything incorrectly, so the only remaining conclusion is that I got a unit that was somehow defective.",1.0

I don't know how much the neighbors like hearing St. Anne's Reel or Cotton Eyed Joe while she plays on our back deck after work, but they can always buy earplugs from Amazon if their taste in music differs from ours.

In addition to her liking these picks for the banjo, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed using a thicker pick with the mandolin.  These picks are not just thicker than most, they are also more rigid, which makes speed picking much easier.  Also, I don't have to get my index finger and thumb so close to the tip of the pick to control it as with a thinner pick, so moving from G to E and back is more comfortable.

This set came with fifteen picks, the same size as a standard guitar pick, just thicker and more rigid.  The picks have a design screen printed on them, which is nice I guess though I bought them to use rather that to look at.

I've attached a few pictures of the picks so you will have a sense of their size in relation to an instrument and my (average sized, I guess) hand.

I received a discount on my purchase of these picks in exchange for agreeing to test them out and provide my honest and unbiased review of them.  These picks are at least as high quality as the Dunlop picks I have used in the past and are significantly higher quality than the Fender picks I have tried.  I highly recommend them and hope to have the opportunity to try out some picks of other thicknesses by this company.",5.0
"This was my 2nd AutoWah and I will say it has many great sounds and works especially well with bass, for which is has a separate input! It can give you that dark blue 70's tone with ease. Does it beat a real WAH? Nope, but it's wonderful if you think of it as a filter. What compelled me to get it was listening to Danny Elfman's use of the WAH in Charley in the Chocolate Factory. Wierd, right... but not really since that had a few very 70's things in there. This autoWah can do that very well. It should be first in your line to take full affect of the WAH's sensitivity but I have so many pedals that I have it after my noise suppressor.

This Wah has a TON of options and is very versatile. But again, it's not a REAL Wah and no matter how many bazillion options won't ever be a real WAH. It's still worth it and BOSS retains their resale value really well.

As far as durability... this is BOSS. They are designed like TANKS. My Boss pedals have fallen and taken vicious beatings. I have a 30 year old boss pedals that has been through everything from smoky clubs, to car wrecks to cockroach infestations and worse! It works perfectly. Boss is amazing.

So buy it. If you don't like it, this is Boss. You can resell it for close to what you paid. Me, I'm keeping mine. :)",5.0

This is a great combo for the mobile DJ. A single rack unit for a compressor and sonic maximizer. Some may poo-poo the sonic maximizer and classify it as a glorified EQ. This unit does a great job of improving the punch of your system and managing volume peaks. The result is a cleaner/tighter sound and reduced volume fluctuations as you mix from track to track. Overall you get a polished sound. Get it if you need it. You won't regret it.,5.0

"With my Christmas  petting-zoo party about to start, I pulled this baby out of the box and prepared for a snow storm. I loaded up some snow liquid mix to the reservoir, plugged her in, and hit the run button. Nothing came out. I read over all of the instructions with no avail. Out of frustration, my inner MacGyver kicked in and I started to disassemble the machine. I could hear and see that both the liquid intake pump and the actual air blower motors were both running but no liquid was being pumped. (*On a side note, you could probably make this machine with a small liquid pump and a mini air pump... seriously.). After a couple of unplugs and replugs of wires, checking leads- I realized the intake pump was just not priming. With a quick tap or so with a hammer to the pump, the pump started to intake the liquid.

Long story short, hit the machine a couple of times to get the pump to prime.",3.0

For my needs, the I found a weighty metal practice mute that sits ontop of the bridge (rather than clamping around it) that seems to do best, so far, for actually dampening out the most noise, although it loses a lot in resonance).  This Ultra mute just doesn't dampen enough for my apartment.",3.0

"I guess the title pretty much lays it out. This is an excellent beginner's Didgeridoo, especially for the price. There are two things to be wary of though.

1. Not all will sold will look like the picture. As in at least one other review, they all look different, so you really shouldn't just expect that it will look like this one. Mine for example, looks the same as the Didge pictured here (as far as I could tell), though the carrying bag is a bit different. It is a striking tie-dyed blue. Still, it seems any design they put out is stunningly beautiful.

2. Now to the mild criticism. The video lessons on the disc/ it's audio tracks are designed to work as a ""website"" and there's a link on it to start which sets it up on the web. All the lessons are informative and worth wile, but there are some problems with them. The videos often break off toward the end and have some skips in them. I think I remember the audio having some minor slip-ups too. Still, it can't be emphasized enough that these are minor slip ups. The audio and video still brings powerful, lessons which make it possible for any willing person to learn this great instrument. Also, you don't need to use it as a website! You can just convert the files and listen/ watch it on your IPod or just on your computer. Itunes seems to automatically convert the audio files and you can get a free video converter on Cnet.com where they spyware test it. I used the ""any video converter."" It worked alright.

That stuff I wrote down in the #2 point was close to getting me to take a star off, so like 4/5 instead of 5/5. My reason to do this would be that it was annoying to have to deal with these very small problems. Though, the positives so out weigh the negatives that it deserves a 5/5 none the less.

Also, it's really easy to clean.

"I was so impressed with my first Bugera 1960 (Emulates Marshall Plexi) I bought a T 5 as a practice amp and now the T 50.  Yesterday I had a practice session with a good friend who has been a pro musician for decades....  he began playing at 12 and is over 60 now.  I had my T 50 hooked up to a Seismic Birch 1 x 12"" empty cabinet with a single Eminence Swamp Thang inside.  He had been headed home but an hour later he's still hooked up and playing.  He said, ""I love this thing.""  When I told him what it cost he couldn't believe it.  He's talking about how one can play around with tubes now because your entry level is so reasonable.  I have a set of Mullards just arrived and this thing doesn't require rebiasing when swapping out tubes.  My friend has at least 20 amps and scavenges pawn shops for particular tubes and speakers.  His carry around combo amp is a heavily customized Fender with alt tubes and a replacement vintage EV speaker.  He quickly was able to get the sound he wanted from the T50/Eminence combination and was grinning from ear to ear.  Its too early to tell about reliability but the Sam Ash guys tell me the reliability issues are in the past.  For those here in LV, the national service center is right here in town.

I assumed that it was HD compatible because of the price point and that it didn't state that is was for m-audio, native or native systems.  The only way I could find this out was by contacting the retailer.  They informed me they are not authorized to sell HD versions of Pro Tools products.  Avid does not disclose who can or cannot sell their various products.

The non-disclosure of this information is inexcusable.",1.0
"When purchasing this tambourine I was debating between this model and Meinl's ""super dry"" line. Overall, the construction on this is sturdy and great, pretty much an A+. However, this tambourine must be the exact opposite of the super dry line. Its very bright, I wish it had a little dirtier of a sound. Also, the tambourine protrudes quite far, it would be better if the mount was on the inside of the tambourine like in the LP cyclops.",3.0

This bag appears to be sturdily constructed and has adequate padding/insulation for casual travel.  It has a large pocket which can accommodate my standard music books such as the Hal Leonard Method (separate review.)  It is a bit baggy for my 1/2 sized Cordoba Requinto travel guitar.,4.0

(NOTE: Ive included an audio file for comparison. First is with the MXL mic, then is just the iPhone 6 built-in mic.)

The main thing I noticed is the background or ambient noise is reduced with this mic. Since it can pick up noise surrounding the mic OR directly in front, its more targeted to where the sound is actually coming from, and that helps.

I record audio for training videos so my experience is based on person audio, although I do really want to try this out with the piano as well.

What I really like:
1. The cord is detachable. This makes it easy to store. (And replace the cord if needed.)
2. The mic pickup for the person directly talking into the mic is great. Useful. Just what I need.
3. Its an iPhone mic. So useful!

My main complaints are:
1. The switches for the pickup pattern and the gain are underneath the surface of the handle. In other words, you need a stick (or a pencil) to switch them. This is to prevent accidentally moving thembut why make it impossible? Also, the instructions don't really say much about these options, and don't actually tell you what icon means what. I guess you're just supposed to know.
2. It doesnt come with a pop filter or a stand, so you have to get those separate. Its probably assumed people buying this mic already have such things? (Also, it doesnt come with those headphones or that weird smartphone in the picture, darnitall.)
3. The case is not big enough to hold the mic, clip, and the cord. (Or at least not after a couple minutes trying.) Why?
4. The price. I did receive this mic through the Vine review program, but I have used a couple of cheap iPhone mics in the past and had been considering trying some better ones. I can tell you the cheap mics just aren't worth it, but jumping up to $100? Unless this is your primary mic, you may want to consider a less expensive option.

"This is the greatest idea ever. (...)you can pick it up instantly at any Toys ""R"" Us store!

It takes a few minutes to warm up, but if you set it up right away, then the rest of your equipment, it'll be ready to go before you are!  I haven't gone through a full tank of juice, so I cannot say how much (or little) it uses, but I did realize the fog juice I received was not ""strawberry scented"" as mentioned.  This isn't a big deal to me.  I let the unit set for 10 minutes or so while setting up a laser light show, pumped out about 4-5 shorter blasts of fog, and it seemed to get very hot.  I'm not sure if this is normal, but something to keep in mind after doing a show as you will want to turn off and unplug the unit to allow it to cool off before packing it up for the night.  It took a while before it seemed cool enough for me to pick up.

"This is a great product, enough has been said by others about how awesome everything is.

People need to know about one little thing, it makes or breaks it for a lot of them. Though not for me.
The dirt pedals can lack the dynamics found in stand-alone units- that from picking and interplay with your guitar's volume knob. If this is a big deal to you try one before you buy it. To me it is not a big deal, all the advantages outweigh this.

Get an expression pedal, it makes the m13 come alive.
I have a patch that utilizes the pitch glide and a drive. Heel down the pitch glide is mix 0, effect 0. toe down the effect is +12 (1 octave up) and like 60% mix - also on toe down the drive reduces some treble to ensure the effect is not too harsh.

This stand does not have as much padding as some of the more expensive ones, but as long as you place your instruments on it carefully (which hopefully you do anyway) there's enough padding to protect them.

"I have an electric Cello & I purposely chose a style that is slim & narrow (like an upright bass), that way I can take it on the bus & train without taking up 3 seats.
I've been looking for a stand since I purchased the instrument, and with the slim styling of my Cello, I couldn't find anything.  This stand works perfectly!  It was exactly what I wanted, if not more.  The weight of the instrument is what activates the locking mechanism, so to remove your instrument, you just grasp the neck and lift it up & out.  Once the weight is off of the stand, the lock opens & you can easily remove your Cello.  I did not know it was going to be that easy to get out!  You can use one hand to put it in & take it out.  I can be ready to play in less than 30 seconds, so its definitely encouraging me to practice more.  :D",5.0

"This pedal is amazing. I wanted to add some effects to my acoustic guitar and be able to do simple loops. I did not however want to get a bunch of pedals, board, interconnections, etc....Although i was prepared to go that route.
That is until i found this pedal.

I have had this for a few weeks and have been very impressed with the sound i get out of my Takamine, and there are features i haven't even gotten in to yet. After going through the manual i realized this thing also works as an EQ.
You have control over almost all the settings if you will just spend some time with the manual understanding how to accomplish what you want.
The great thing about having 50 memory channels is that you don't have to worry about having the manual with you. Set it up, save it to a channel, and your settings are saved.
I am very pleased with this pedal and am looking forward to getting even more in depth with what it can do.

Cons:
1. The looper doesn't have a way to undo the last loop. So if you have a really nice loop going and you botch the third overdub, you have to start all over.
2. To stop the loop you have to double tap the button.

Number 2 is an easy fix as i just order the FS-6 and assigned one of the buttons stop the loop. (The manual tells you how to do this).

If you are looking for an all in one pedal to smooth out and enhance your acoustic guitar and your vocals, while being able to do some cool simple background loops (vocally or guitar), this is absolutely the pedal for you.
If you are looking for a looper pedal to build whole songs or to do separate loops that you can stop and start individually, then this is not the pedal for you.",4.0

No biggie really as it does not interfere or alter anything when playing.  Might have to spend some time adjusting the fit and where it attaches to banjo.  I had to swing the fretting end of the strap around the base of the neck and resonator so that the banjo would stay angled without any handling to support the neck - but this is more the banjo than any issue with the strap.,3.0

If you're looking for a good slap echo effect, I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE-1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo, but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal.

"The main reason for getting the faderport was to be able to remain in my vocal booth and constantly undo and redo recordings without having to jump out and hit play on my computer every time.

When I first got the machine, I was working on Vista 32-bit. From the start, I had problems getting my computer to recognize it and use it within Pro Tools 7.4. After many hours of troubleshooting and tech support, I finally got it to work. Then I upgraded my computer to a Windows 7 64-bit. Again, I had some major issues and then finally got it to work. I had to unplug ALL midi devices, use a USB powered hub, and had to install the firmware update using another computer. It eventually worked.

I upgraded computers again to another Windows 7 64-bit and it (of course) did not work with the firmware update and all solutions mentioned above. Never got it to work, and every time I called tech support, they had no reasons or fixed. It became a paper weight. I was desperate and was thinking about getting the alphatrack.

After months of being a paper weight, I yet again got another AMAZING PC computer with Windows 7 64-bit. BRAND NEW EVERYTHING! Still didn't work and neither did the firmware update which it says should work for Win 7 32 or 64-bit systems.

I thought maybe it was the faderport so I opted for getting a new one from guitar center and lo and behold, IT DIDN'T WORK!!!

New computer (two of them), and and new faderport without any luck. And trust me, I tried every Google search and possible solution with no fix. I have given up. The tech support told me last week that they will now do testing and try do come out with a new driver. That is a flat out lie to my face and to everyone. This has been a well known issue for over 2 years and NO ONE and presonus has updated a thing.

Bottom line, this product was AMAZING when it worked and did everything it was supposed to. I strongly urge people to NOT get this if they have Windows 7 64-bit or I think ANY 64-bit system for that matter.  It's a real shame that the guys at presonus are lazy. This was a great product and now I have to look elsewhere.",2.0

Next problem is that the lyre isn't straight. If you look at the picture you have the ring that hooks onto your clarinet, then a washer (for lack of a better word) and then the actual lyre. There are 3 main pieces. If you loosen the washer and then retighten the ring you can eventually line up the lyre and ring so it's straight.

"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years and I really wanted to like this little electric guitar as a tool for young musicians to get started making music. What my experience was, unfortunately, that this is little more than a toy that is a pain in the behind to even build.

 THE BUILD 

The guitar comes nicely packaged and the pieces are all clearly packaged and labeled. The first step was to use 6 small screws to attach the tuning posts and that is where I ran into my first problem.

A few of the screws went in easily, but a couple would not, eventually stripping the heads of the screws before they were sitting flush against the tuners.

The neck attached easily with two screws but never seemed to be completely stable.

The strap hooks again presented an issue with a screw that did not want to fully enter the guitar body on the top hook.

I understand the story that it's good to have your child build this themselves, but it's not something I would recommend. Great care has to be taken to make sure you can get this together without stripping the screws.

 THE SOUND 

This is a very basic electric guitar with one pickup. The sound from that pickup does sound nice and clean and I did not have any issues with the pickup or volume of the instrument.

The main problem with the sound is that, even with the strings in tune, the guitar never really sounds in tune. It is always oscillating back and forth for a very unpleasant sound unless you're running the guitar through some distortion.

While I again get the concept of the smaller, three-string guitar for younger players I am not really sure how much good starting here would do them, if any, over starting on a six-string guitar. The chords provided in the book with the guitar are basically just the bottom 3 strings of any 6-string chord and they just don't sound right at all.

 VALUE 

This is probably where I have the biggest issue with this little instrument. These guitars are selling for between $161 and $299 here on Amazon and you can find some pretty decent full-sized electric guitars on sale here for less.

 CONCLUSION 

I can see where this guitar could be a simple little starter guitar but when they're priced more than some decent full-sized 6-string guitars I have a very hard time recommending them. If the price point topped out at around $100 they'd be much easier to recommend to a parent trying to get their younger kids started into playing. With the size of this guitar, anyone over 12 years old should probably start with a full-sized guitar anyway.

"I've installed these pickups in four different guitars: three dreadnoughts and a Larrivee L body. I did find that the adhesive strips supplied for the microphone part seem to lose their grip after a while. I made replacements from more permanent 3M tape and it seems better.

Tone is good, but not great. It sounds better than a UST pickup, but still far from natural. Tone is compressed and midrange-ey, lacking bass. The position of the microphone has a huge impact on the sound and at the suggestion of the folks at Baggs I wound up installing the microphone part in alternate locations to what is shown in the instructions to get the best sound. I have these in two guitars I play out with, but I seldom use them. I have a K&K Meridian microphone setup that works much better where feedback isn't a big issue.

Bottom line . . . I really WANT to like this microphone/pickup and the folks at LR Baggs have been very helpful, but it seems to fall short of the hype. Other people report better results than I have. Maybe it depends on the guitar.",3.0

I didn't complain or send it back after I plugged it in and heard the nice tones from this guitar. For the price I decided not to bother. Very good tone. Nice crunch from the pick ups. Sustain is excellent. I did have to adjust all 6 string saddles to get the intonation correct. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I am very pleased with the Dean ZX!",4.0

"Hardware installation is as expected.  A little difficult but manageable.
Software installation is a mess, poorly documented, and poorly written.
Fishman has you driving from SF to LA via China.
They tell you to install everything, but only the Fishman software install is essential.
If you setup the hardware as described and plug the wireless USB into a usb port,
the pickup will work with Reason or other popular midi diven software.
The software comes with Triple Play (Fishman), SampleTank, Komplete, Notion, and Studio One.
All of these programs were written by folks with very little knowledge of how to write a user interface.
The screens are generally sloppy, not intuitive, and some (like SampleTank) do not work at all (for me).
This is a product where Fishman tells you it is great and hopes you believe it!
I think the product is heading in the right direction, but has a long way to go.
I own a Roland GR-55.  The GR-55 has much less latency and is much more mature and intuitive.
I bought the Fishman TriplePlay because the tracking/latency is suppose to be better.
Supposedly, you can bend strings with the TriplePlay and it will track (not!).
Latency is worse than the GR-55 and bending does not work at all.
I will keep the TriplePlay as my buddies like to play with it as a novelty
and maybe someday, Fishman will fix it's shortcomings (a tall order).
Wait a few years and the software may improve.....",2.0

"This is my first speaker ever. I just needed an acoustic/mic set up so I was lookin lower budget. So for anyone in my situation read on! Looking up an down decent brands I found this low budget Yamaha to be the best among low budget powered speakers based purely off reviews and forums. I only bought one. If you need somethin extremely bass-ey you're gonna need a sub. Which is kinda obvious but I thought Id say it. But! I use a Taylor acoustic mainly.. with the guitars own EQ if I leave the bass normal the low E(E2) sounds great. If I turn the bass knob up on the guitar the speaker will rumble and rattle everything. Not chest thumping but very deep and very smooth. The highs on the guitar with the volume all the way up on the speaker and my guitar are clean and precise and a bit warm so its not ear piercing an harsh by any means. A nice keyboard would sound fantastic.. I can overpower our drummer with volume, not drown out but definitely get up higher then him. Especially with vocals which I use a ShureSM58 for anyone who cares. I have pierced my own ears with the mic and this speaker though haha. And it still didn't clip. Thats in a garage band setting too with loud acoustics goin on. We opened the garage up and walked about 100 ft away and the speaker still sounded super clear and loud. I couldve definitely walked 4-500 ft away and heard it just fine. Although thats with no crowd or noise in between.. so take that for what its worth. Living on 1-2 acre properties I know my neighbors can definitely hear it with the garage open. So for my super basic use of this speaker Im incredibly happy with it. Its more expensive but nothing about it has disappointed me at this point. From its sound/volume to its design/weight. Ive only used the back inputs and adjustability it has and my acoustics bass/treble EQ so Ive done nothing fancy with the sound here and have definitely not stress tested it(except with the mic that one time which I mentioned above- in which it passed). I highly recommend this though. For anyone whos serious about sound quality but on a budget this thing won't disappoint.",5.0

The product itself is very ""get what you pay for"", but the main issue currently is their drivers. When I first bought the device, their website had their official drivers that worked flawlessly and provided great sound quality both in and out. Now coming almost a year after Windows 10's release, there is no official support from Behringer for the device, and it is done by some other 3rd party of an all-in-one driver called ""ASIO4ALL"". I contacted support and they said they would be releasing a driver for Windows 10 shortly. That was around 5-6 months ago, and there is still no official support from Behringer. These 3rd party drivers restrict the quality and have compatibility issues. Just go for a better quality or simply different AI, they seem to have abandoned this one.",1.0

"If you know guitars like I do you realize each one is as individual as your friends, so I'll tell you about mine which may not be like your purchase of this model.

I picked this up while at a friend's music store and thought to myself, wow. Balanced and comfortable from end to end. I looked it over and seeing the TonePros bridge I thought...check...and the noticing the ebony neck, I thought...check...and with its good looks I had to ask the price. I almost dropped it!

So I brought it home and proceeded to to put pure nickel 10's on it. This comes with 9's so it required pulling out the welding tip cleaners to open up the nut a bit and then I plugged in. Now if you didn't realize it, both the ebony neck and nickel strings create a darker sound which is my own preference at times, so this became nicely dark and rich (whoa, too much coffee!).

You should read the description, but I'll hit the highlights. This is a short neck which means a short reach but only 22 frets. It has passive old style electronics and I really find those to be the most versatile for all styles. The tone and  volume controls are the opposite placement from traditional however and I like it. It came with a bag and tools, which aren't standard types, because of the bridge and PRS uses a different truss rod tool.

So as it came was good but I can never leave guitars alone so I put an Air Zone pickup in the bridge which makes it even darker. I also had the nut replaced and the frets touched up, spending about another $240 on it. It now sits proudly next to my 2-$4000 guitars and I like playing it more than some of them. If your experience with guitars is limited, let me explain my feelings on them. New, they're like a used car and everyone could point out something about it they oould improve, so don't think buying this you'll have to fix it. It's just preferences.",5.0

"I saw this pedal on sale for quite a low price and grabbed it. The regular BBE Green Screamer is a well regarded TS808 style pedal, and the G Screamer is based on that pedal but with more harmonic content in the low-mids and a bit more oomph. I use it the way many heavy style players use ""TS"" style pedals -- with with ouput/volume maxed and the gain on zero, with the tone set to taste. This pushes my amp, which I keep the gain set moderate on, to the perfect sweet spot for heavy rhythm playing. It gives more balls and power to my sound while also tightening up the lows and focusing the midrange. I greatly prefer this sound to just simply maxing out the amp gain, which (in my opinion) sounds washed out and muddy, plus gets lost in a mix. Boosting a medium gain amp sound with a nice overdrive is one of the all time great ways to get a tight, focused, and ballsy heavy rhythm tone, and this pedal is an overlooked sleeper for that purpose. Grab one and I think you'll be pleased. Also, this pedal is very quiet with minimal hiss and has a nice blue LED.",5.0

"My kids are very amused by this blue tooth speaker light! Honestly, I am pretty amused with it myself!
To get the bulb to work, we had to go to google play store on our Android phone, and download an app called JBSmartBulb. The app downloaded quickly with no problems.
Our phones connect to the bulb quickly, with no problems and stay connected until out of range, which is a pretty good distance!
On the app you can choose what you want the bulb to do or what colors to show. It is really neat.
The sound quality is a lot better then I expected it to be, and it really clear and gets really loud!

"When they showed up, and I opened the box, 2 of the 4 cable clips (to keep your cables neat) had been broken at the point where they insert into the stand, which is fine, I only really need one on each stand.  The base thankfully gives you the option of using their metal feet (included) or the plastic feet that come already screwed into the bottom.  I had to go with the metal feet anyway, because 1 of the 6 plastic feet (3 feet on each stand base) was broken off within the base, which required a great deal of work to remove - the metal foot will only screw in so far into it, as I think there is still plastic shreds in the threading.  Other than that, the adjustability is great, with three height settings, and the base is sturdy without taking up too much space (17.5"" equilateral triangle).  The platforms which are small compared to the size of my monitors (Event TR8s) still evenly support the weight, even with Auralex pads underneath.",3.0

"Well, first of all I must say that I'm an experienced drummer, and not tone-deaf. Still, tuning my drums was a long and often frustrating process.

It took me a lot of time to get a beautyful, resonant sound from one head, then I moved on to the other head of the same drum, and when I thought it was nice too I played it - just to find out that the heads were out-of-tune with each other... At this point I would start to make adjustments on one head in order to try to fix this, and usually got it right, but not all the times. Then, I would start the whole thing on the next drum... It took me a couple of hours to tune the whole kit - and it's a standard five-piece drumset! Not to mention that it was not rare to have one tom with a nice, full sound, and the one next to it sounding a bit like a plastic trash can...

Sounds familiar? Well, I must say that those days are over. Now, with this key I can easily and quickly have the sound I want from each drum. It is very easy to get both heads resonating - and it makes a BIG difference on he sound. It also encouraged me to quickly and effectively try different tensions and explore the whole pitch range of the toms and snare drum. I'm proud to say that, after playing the same kit for almost ten years, I'm finally discovering my drums' true sound.

That said, remember: for this key to work, you need to have a drum with flat shell borders, flat hoops, lubricated and aligned lugs and tension rods, and new heads. Otherwise the tension reading on the lugs will be inaccurate. Also, you might still need a regular drumkey for fine tuning - and for the hardware: this key is not supposed to mess around with tom holders and cymbal stands!",5.0

It's a really lite guitar and a nice small neck, don't misunderstood me, is not a bad sound, it's for kind of indie sound... you play strokes and it sounds really well, but not for heavy distortions... like nirvana.

"Cubase PC guy here. After being an RME and Focusrite user for a long time, I bought this interface as I had good experiences in the past with PreSonus gear and since Focusrite became too unreliable with their updated interfaces as of late, and boy, do I regret getting the PreSonus.

I tried it on two systems, one at work and at one at home, running Windows 7 and 10 respectively, and it may be one of the most unstable interfaces that I've used on a PC. At times, after coming out of a certain program like Cubase, iZotope RX or even stuff like Adobe Premiere, the interface would just stop putting out any audio. Switching from 44.1k to 48k or 96k and back also caused the interface to completely stop working, and only a complete system reboot would get it back to working again.

There are some nice features on this interface for how small it is in comparison to that price range, but unfortunately, this was unusable for me.

I had high expectations, also since there aren't that many USB 3.0 interfaces out there, but I virtually couldn't tell the difference between this and any of the other 2.0 interfaces.

Since Focusrite started being unreliable since their latest update of their Scarlet soundcards, I was in dire need of a new card, and am now using the Steinberg UR 44. Can only recommend that card for those of you out there that are on PC and Steinberg software. Either that or RME is the way to go, probably.

"This is an adequate boom for the price. So far it works as designed. I like the wire minder on the back end.

I have 3 problems with most booms made these days and cannot find one that is designed differently at any price.

1) the adjustment knob for the slider is on top where it just looks clunky and ugly from most vantage points. Put it on the side for a cleaner look on stage.

2) the pivot adjustment is this cheap thin sliding lever. Can I get a decent T or star knob that would last longer and not hurt my hands so much?

3) older boom had a nice heavy weight on the back end so that when extended there would be a certain amount of counter balance.  Not anymore. That thick ""handle"" on the back end weighs nothing, why is it even there?

Again, not so much a fault of this brand because they all seem to be this way these days. Just a complaint in general. This boom seems sturdily made and is a good deal for the price.",4.0

"The X4 is a great DCO based synth. Strings, deep bass, piano, wind instruments, it covers it all. I even was able to program in a convincing grand piano. Plenty of modulation options, 3 envelops, 4 LFOs plus the crazy sub Octave, feedback and audio mod. You can easily go from a mellow main part to the deep riff on lucky man. Organ sounds are soso, this is why I have a M3. To fully appreciate this synth it is wise to have a decent set of monitors ( I have mission) and a powered sub is a must, I set mine to 160h z, running through an onkyo 75w ss amp. 44 keys like the voyager, keeps it light and compact. 4 voices are plenty, and can be stacked and detuned in unison.

"I am an amateur musician (mostly guitars, also keyboards) and producer.  I have been writing and recording music for about 20 years, mostly on Digital Audio standalone devices such as the Roland VS1680.  Reason/Record Duo is my second DAW, my first attempt was with Cakewalk.
I had problems getting Cakewalk to work properly so I gave up with it and bought the VS1680.  I enjoy that machine very much and recorded 30+ songs on it.  But I found several limitations with it frustrating and decided it was time to move up.

My nephew, a Full Sale graduate in Recording Sciences, recommended Pro Tools, but other very good friends who are professional musicians and are familiar with my work recommended Propellerheads Reason/Record.  The reason: Reason/Record are far more intuitive and user-friendly.  So I bought the software.

I had an initial difficulty getting the drivers for the interface (M-audio) to work with the software, but a couple of days of trouble shooting resolved this.  The problem was with getting the software to recognize the interface, which I resolved after a day of tinkering.  Then I had problems with midi latency, which took another couple of days (and several uninstall, reinstall processes before I finally got the procedure down right--the order of installing the software with the interface OFF or disconnected was VERY important in getting it to work.  However, I have to say that without the help of my nephew and the input I found at the Propellerheads Forums, it would have been difficult.  That's not a problem with Reason/Record, just a typical difficulty that some DAW software has, a natural complication.  Once I got it running, however, it worked very well.

AS for the product, it is absolutely amazing, especially if you work in electronic music.  I am a guitarist first, keyboardist only to arrange music, so many of the sounds are out of my style, but they are still incredible and give me a new sound to work with.  My keyboard is a Roland XP50, an antiquated synth, but it had ""OK"" sounds.  I have found that the synths in Reason have more than adequate if not incredible sounds.  However, I do NOT like their brass, bass, and a few other sounds.  These are fine for hip-hop and groove-based music, but simply inadequate for acoustic-style or rock-based compositions.  The solution is simple: Propellerheads has an astoundingly good ""REFILL"" for hyper-sampled piano, bass, and drums, so you have the ability to load some AMAZINGLY realistic instruments to fill that gap.

The sampled piano that comes in the onboard sampler is quite good, without even having to buy their hyper-sampled piano.  (but the sampled bass instruments kind of stink) Their drum loops are excellent and very easily tailored to personal tastes.

The interface for the software took a little getting used to.  I ordered the Reason tutorial from ProAudioDVDs.com and it got me running.  I still have not finished even half of the tutorial, as the first half was more than enough to get me past my previous misunderstanding of how it worked.

Creating a new instrument is very easy, and all youhave to do is click on that instrument and then create any FX you want and it is automatically routed properly.  All instruments and FX are displayed in a cool rack formation.  Additional creative routing is easy, the TAB button ""flips"" the rack and you can see visual representations of the patch cords going into and out of all the instruments and effects and the main mixing board.

Sequencing is a dream in the software, it is so visually stimulating.  Whereas Roland works with PATTERNS and SONG structure, in which you create a pattern that repeats when called up in the song, Reason works with BLOCKS and SONG.  So you can create a musical BLOCK of any length that will repeat when you instert it into the SONG view.  Record uses the Reason sequencing but then adds audio recording ability and tracks.

The HELP function on the software is one of the best I've seen, providing clear, concise step by step instructions for any task.  They also provide a FANTASTIC 600+ page manual that I bought as a reference, which does not assume expertise so it starts with the basics and works into more detailed and complex uses.

I will now be able to fully produce songs of many styles without having to buy loads of new gear.  The sequencing interface is FAR more intuitive than the ones in keyboard workstations that I've worked with, and the recording interface is WAY more powerful than any digital audio workstation I've seen.

The platform has been EXTREMELY stable, not a single crash or glitch.  SO I give this software a 4+ stars.  I don't give it a 5 star rating because Ithink they could have improved on the quality of their basic instruments a little.",4.0

"Was looking to add some distortion/fuzz to fatten up some of the really rockin bits of a few songs in my band's set. Everyone said don't just add a guitar distortion pedal because it won't translate the lower frequency.

This thing sounds fantastic! I run it in line straight from my 5 string (not through the effects loop) and it is quiet as a mouse until you hit it, then WOW! You don't lose any of your bottom end, but it just adds a really nice distortion/fuzz/overdrive sound. I am completely happy with this and would buy another one in a heartbeat if something happened to it. (For the money I saved by not buying the Boss, I could afford to!)

"Behringer makes a slew of pedals, from terrific to mediocre. This one falls somewhere in between. It has a number of interesting effects that more or less simulate a Leslie speaker sound, and some variations, but it has a light that flashes when it is on that is very annoying. This changes from red to blue depending on whether you've chosen slow or fast speed. You can't turn this off. It will constantly flash, even when you're not using the pedal. It's quite distracting, and if you cover it up with tape or something, you won't be able to see when it's on or off. That alone is enough to turn me off from this unit.

The other annoying feature is that although you can change from slow to fast while playing without having to stop and change a setting, this requires a 2 second holding down of the pedal. That wasn't quite the issue with me, as I usually just use a single setting for most songs and only occasionally adjust it to something different, but that, combined with the fact that the flashes change from ""mostly red"" to ""mostly blue"" also means you have to pay more attention to this pedal instead of concentrating on your playing. The Behringer Vibrato pedal doesn't do quite the same thing, but I much prefer it because it has no issues, unlike this one.",3.0
"I've played guitar for about 15 years.  I've had the good fortune to be able to record some of my music and have played in front of thousands of people.  What I mean to say is, I kind of know my way around a guitar at this point.  Up til now, the capo is something that I've rarely used for the simple fact that none of them have worked very well.  It seems like just when you get them set up so that everything is in tune, the strings will go out of tune after five minutes of playing.  This is EXTREMELY frustrating.  In the past, when I needed a capo I would either transpose the song or tune the whole guitar up a half step.  I therefore had low hopes for the Planet Waves NS Artist Guitar Cape by D'Addario, but decided to give it a shot.

I'm glad I did!  This is a superior improvement in technology.  In short, it's a capo that ACTUALLY WORKS!

Here are the details:

(NOTE: I did not try it out on an acoustic guitar, just an electric, so I'm not sure if these result will translate to the higher action of an acoustic.)

So, I plugged in my Stratocaster to my amp (Traynor, by the way... very good amp for the price!)  I tuned my guitar to standard tuning using a clip-on Snark tuner.  (Although this  Planet Waves capo has a slot to attach a D'Addario tuner to it, I did not buy that tuner, so can't comment on that.  I had a Snark tuner already, so I used that to tune.)  Once everything was set up, I clipped on the Planet Waves Capo to the first fret.  Then I rechecked the tuning.

Well, after attaching the capo, the top three strings were now sharp.  I had to retune to guitar with capo on.  That was a little concerning.  After the guitar was retuned, I put the capo through its paces.

Usually the only reason you might use a capo is if you want to play open chords on the first few frets, but in a different key.  Because of how a guitar is built, it's pretty easy to play a song using barrre chords if you want to play in a different key--- but when you do that you lose the ringing open strings.  Hence, the capo!  (People who have never bothered to learn barre chords might also use a capo.)  Anyhow, I played a couple songs like this, strumming or arpeggiating notes.  Then I checked the tuning.  All the strings were still in tune!  So, good news there.

Then I decided to up the ante.  I then played a Stevie Ray Vaughan song, and really bent the heck out of the top four strings during the solo.  Now, this is not really fair to the capo.  Also, no one would really do this.  You don't usually use a capo if you're going to be playing this type of music.  What did I find?  After bending the heck out of the strings--- which should have made the strings go out of tune on any normal capo--- all the strings except the G were still in tune!  Then it was kind of weird.  The G string at first was a little sharp.  After a couple seconds, though, it went back in tune... maybe after it settled down.  I don't know.  I tried this a couple times, and each time every string stayed in tune except the G, but after a couple seconds, it always eventually went back in tune as well.  I never needed to retune.  I have no idea what this was about, but all the strings rapidly readjusted to being in tune after a couple of seconds.

The capo has a spring mechanism and a trigger like device to attach it to your guitar.  It's really easy to attach, not hard to put on and off.  I think it's this spring that is the innovation--- it must more equally distribute the pressure or something.  The back of the capo is also contoured to fit the back of the guitar neck like a glove--- probably also helping to more equally distribute pressure.  There is a slot to attach a tuner to the capo---- which sounds like it might be a cool innovation--- but, as mentioned, I didn't have the proper tuner to try this out.

There is a simple, boring reason this Planet Waves capo is so much better than any other one I've tried.  The simple reason is this:

IT WORKS!!!!!!

So, first, lets just say THIS THING IS GREAT. I had it setup in about 20 mins-- the programs that come with it are fabulous. I think you would want at *LEAST* two packs of them. They are exceptionally bright. I did not have time to test some of the more advanced control options.

Now for some observations:
* The controller box must be placed close to the tubes, so plan accordingly.
* The mounting hardware was a little bit flimsy to me. It will get the job done, but I would prefer it was more substantial.
* The travel case was just not road-worthy to me. The hardware can slosh around in there and damage the tubes-- which themselves are somewhat delicate. I am going to cut out some foam spacers for the travel case to make sure that can't happen, but it just seems like an oversight.

The boxes contains: the tuner, power supply, RCA cables, remote, and batteries for the remote. You will have to get your own HDMI cable but those are common enough.

"I got my new bass after 8 days of sitting patiently by the door waiting on the UPS man. Once it arrived, I tore into it excitedly, admiring the GORGEOUS transparent blue sunburst paint-job, eagerly awaiting the chance to play my brand new 4-stringer, only to be disappointed by the glaring oversight of Steadman's QC. The body has multiple blemishes: scratch spots, dents, etc, and the rosewood fretboard appears to not have even been oiled, as it still looks freshly sanded, add on the fact that one of the tuners in the headstock keeps buzzing, and I can say I'm not too happy a camper.
The most outlandish defect I've come across so far is that the nut is made of (very) cheap plastic, and the A-string keeps popping out with anything more than slight pressure, which means not only do I have to adjust the very high action to a more playable height, I'll also need a new nut before this thing is even remotely playable.
Extras Overview:
Although advertised otherwise, this bass doesn't come with extra strings, it comes with an extra g-string only.
Included cleaning cloth is soft, and lint-free.
Included strap is apparently only mean to be worn by children, as at full length, the bass comes up to my collar bone.
Included cable is terrible, and barely works, get yourself a new one, pronto.
Gig bag is alright, don't expect it to protect against more than the most minor of bumps and scratches.

Pros:
Beautiful paint-job.
Decent quality pick-guard.
Pickups sound nice, and tone/volume pots are smooth and noise-free.
Frets are polished to a mirror finish.

Cons:
Completely messed up nut.
Multiple bumps, scratches, and blemishes on the surface.
Fretboard seems unfinished, needs oil.
Included strings are dull, and lifeless.
Headstock rattles with every note played. (Something loose in one of the tuners.)

All in all, I give this bass guitar 3 stars. I'd give it a 2.5 stars if I could, but for the price, it could be worse. I was hoping for better quality for $85, but I guess that's too much to ask for from Steadman.

It comes with a ton of amp models but truth be told I only find a handful useful.  I basically only use the SLO, Plexi and Blackface models to create my patches.....the rest are just...meh

"I purchased this for a Jackson Kelly guitar and was absolutely pleased with the product.  The construction was solid.  The large clips are easy to open and close and the inside pocket is perfect for a cord and pics. The locking mechanism is your standard mini-key type lock.  The inside is molded and it fit the Jackson guitar like a glove. If you plan on keeping your guitar in the case longterm, the only drawback is that it stands only on its side and you can't stand it upright, so it becomes a bit of a space hog. However, given that these types of guitars are not the best shape for upright positioning, perhaps you wouldn't risk an upright standing anyways.

In terms of the shipment, although it came at light speed, I would suggest better packaging when shipping.  The outside of my box was crushed and I thought that the case would be damaged for sure.  Luckily, with the sturdy construction and a protective, material sleeve over the case, the case was still in perfect condition.  I think the main issue is the empty space in the box, but some bubble pack around the case, in the box, would be a quick solution.  The fact that it wasn't damaged at all says something for the construction of the case itself.

"I have been a guitar player for 25 years but never played a mandolin.  I wanted one that was inexpensive and chose this after reading the mostly good reviews.  The instrument looks great and stays in tune very well.  At first, I was VERY disappointed because the intonation was way off.  Not knowing anything about a mandolin, I assumed that this was because it was a cheap instrument.  There did not appear to be any way to adjust the intonation.  For those who don't know what I'm referring to, with a stringed instrument if the intonation is off you will tune it perfectly only to find out that as you play chords up the neck they are horribly out of tune.

Unlike many instruments (like an electric guitar), you can't adjust the individual intonation for each string.  I found out that with a mandolin the entire bridge moves.  It appears to be glued to the front of the instrument but that is not the case.  The bridge actually moves, so you will adjust it fore or aft to achieve the intonation (carefully so as not to scratch or damage the surface).

If you don't know how to adjust the intonation, just google the phrase ""adjust intonation on a mandolin"" and there are several guides as to how to do this.  Basically, you just carefully adjust the moveable bridge to achieve this.  You want the open string pitch to be in tune with the pitch fretted at the 12th fret.  If it is sharp or flat, you adjust the bridge accordingly by moving it.  You will find it easier to loosen the strings then retune after getting it right.  Once you do this and retune, you won't be disappointed!",5.0

"I'm sort of fussy about which strings I used on my fiddles, and after years of playing, I've narrowed my choices down to three or four products that I purchase regularly. I've noticed that each of my fiddles seem to favor a certain type of string and that a certain type of string will always sound better than others. I have fiddles strung up with steel, stranded-core steel, and synthetic strings, and I have my favorite brands of each. I have used Zyex before, but I haven't tried these strings on all my fiddles to see how they sound. This time I took the time to try them on several different instruments to see if the sound quality held up across the board. I'm happy to say they produced a great tone on every instrument I put them on, and I find them very playable. I also liked the short break-in time...it seems almost as short as steel strings. Within a day they'd done most of their stretching, and held their tuning very nicely. I normally play Thomastik Vision Solo strings on my favorite fiddle, and I don't think the Zyex sounded as good as the Visions, but they were definitely very good. Overall, Zyex strings are an excellent choice for a player who loves the sound and feel of synthetic strings, but doesn't want to dish out $60+ for other top synthetic brands. My only complaint, which is minor, is the aluminum-wound D. Most of the synthetic core strings I play have aluminum-wound A strings, and they seem to be the most break-prone. I haven't broken a D string yet, but it does worry me. I see that you can purchase individual D strings for about $13, so that's nice. In any case, I'd score these strings about 8+ overall on a scale of 1 to 10 (combining scores for durability, playability, tone and cost).",5.0

"I bought (4), but will return two of them.  I was hoping they were better tuned, consistently, so that more than one could be played together.  They are well enough tuned to be enjoyed as solo ""instruments"", but are more like high-quality toys than musical instruments.  They can provide some stress relief as one zones out while playing it, and unique melodies can be found in each drum.  They play best with light taps, not heavy strikes.  They are certainly not in the league of Steve Roberts' and Michael Thiele's drums, in either tone or tuning, but those higher-end drums cost several hundred dollars - this affordable option is still fun and playable.  Any non-musician who tries it will enjoy getting lost for a few minutes, becoming mesmerized by the feedback.  Musicians accustomed to better-tuned instruments may lose interest quickly, but they will still smile.

PROS:
- made in USA, not imported junk.  (still, don't expect a Cadillac ... it's more of a Chevy)
- heavy, solid, well made
- nice, attractive heavy-grained wood (Ash and Oak)
- price, includes mallets

CONS:
-inconsistent tuning
- logo on side detracts from the natural wood (should be smaller)
- low volume, if best tone is desired.  (can also be played loud enough such that nearby items vibrate and buzz, but the tuning then suffers)",4.0

"Ok, I got into true DJing about 2 weeks ago, and I was looking for an entry level setup at a reasonable price.  I ordered this mixer and 2 Numark NDX400 CD/MP3 players.  Let me address the pro's and cons of this mixer that I have discovered so far:

Pros:

Surprisingly durable construction.  The whole housing is constructed of metal, with plastic faders and knobs.  The faders and knobs feel rather cheap, which didn't really surprise me, given the price.

Crossfader is good.  Durable, no; but you won't be hearing the other track through the mains when you're all the way over to the other side.

Cons:

The BPM counter, the main selling point of this product, is absolute junk.  If this is a big point for you, look elsewhere, because it's nowhere near in the ballpark.  I have decent BPM counters on my NDX400s, and they are way closer on the guess than the VMX100's.  Put tape over the screens or something, because all they will do is distract you.

EQ is a little lacking.  First off, it's 2-band (Low and High) not 3-band (Low, Mid, and High), and this kinda bummed me out.  The ""Kill"" option works decently well at taking off the bass so that you can combine songs without clashing basslines, but the High kill leaves a lot to be desired.  I was looking for that underwater-type effect when I killed it, which I'm guessing if it had a Mid-EQ I could achieve.  No such luck here though.

Bottom line is this:  If you're looking for a 2-channel DJ mixer just to get you started into beatmatching, phrase-matching, etc. then this mixer is perfect for you.  Nothing on it has died/fizzled out so far, so I'll say it's reliable.  If you're looking for a feature-rich mixer, keep moving, because this thing gives you the bare bones, and that's it.",3.0

"I bought both the 6 string and 12 string version of this case at the same time.  The overall design and workmanship of these cases is great.  The 6 string case is replacing an old chipboard case I've been using for 20+ years... this case is way better in every sense.  I'm sure it's the last case I will ever buy for that guitar.

Compared side-by-side, the 12 string version of the case is only *slightly* longer than the 6 string version.  On the inside, you can clearly see the 12-string version allows for a larger headstock, but the overall length just isn't much longer than the 6 string version.

I can tell you for sure that my Epiphone FT-160 Texan 12 did not fit.  It was about an inch short.  The headstock area inside the case wasn't the issue - it was the overall length that didn't allow it to fit.

Another note about the case... it's actually a rigid case.  For some reason I thought it was a nicely padded, but fold-up-able(?) gig bag.  This is actually more like a hard case with a soft outside.  It has backpack straps, which is nice, but it definitely not a case you can fold up and stow away when not in use.",3.0

"I traded in my American Strat for this and have no regrets. The Strat always had too big of a neck and was a little too rowdy for me. The neck on this is nice and comfy. The only quarrel I have with this guitar is the action. It seems like a strange battle to get the action and tross rod in the sweet spot with minimal buzz. Not sure if this is just a tele thing or if  I'm too used to setting up strats. I have an annoying ear for buzz, so even the slightest buzz will bother me. I will probably be taking this guitar in to a good luthier to have him set it up the best he can, and install a new nut and saddles (those graphtech ones are pretty sweet!).

a word about the pickups:
This thing is crazy. So you have a three way switch. Neck, both, bridge. Neck is that nice warm and dark tele sound... bridge is that tele twang. Beautiful on either or both. The insane thing is the tone knob. I have no idea what it's called, but once you pass where other knobs should be at value ""0"" there is extra room to turn... like negative values.. the tone turns into something really strange, bizarre and honestly quite wonderful. Not sure if that's supposed to happen on this tele or if I have a strange fluke,... but it's incredibly surprising and awesome. With the way the tone knob affects the pick ups, i'd not consider changing them until they're dead or something presents itself for a great deal.",5.0

The humming bird went to the girls, but had to be cut down just a little to fit her guitar. Fortunately, it was a cheaper material, and that made it very easy to cut down.

The Red and Tortoise are prints, and NOT the typical translucent tortoise shell I was hoping for, but again, they are what you see, and what you pay for. The adhesive is a mild polymer, and should remove easily with heat, when the time comes to replace it.

"I carry around an LPK25, an LPD8, and a Go Mic in my laptop bag for beatmaking on the go.

Considering the only thing remotely close to the LPK is that crappy looking thing called the Nanokey, this is the laptop controller to get.  Build quality is great.  The keys and housing are sturdy.  The keys are small but the feel is good enough that you can get melodic with them.  Unlike the Nanokey, which feels like Korg put a bunch of spacebars side by side, Akai actually made an effort to make this thing feel like a keyboard.

The same Arppegiator that Akai uses in their MPK series comes with this and you can set up everything via software.  The sustain button can either be used to sustain the key you're playing or latch the arppegiator sequence.  There's a tap tempo button if you don't want to use an external MIDI clock for the arp.  And the bottom two buttons are use to transpose up and down.  They light up to let you know whether you're at a higher or lower octave.

That's all there is to it.  There's no pitch bend or modulation, but I'm guessing that's because they wanted people to buy the LPK too.  If you can afford both the LPK and LPD, you can use one of the LPD knobs to control pitch, mod, velocity, etc.

I'm glad Akai upped the bar on this.  There's so much more that can be done with laptop controllers and between Akai, Korg, and Vestax, there should be a lot of cool new gear coming out over the next few years.",5.0

I discovered it was very difficult to get the bass pedal action to feel just right while at the same time get the beater to strike the head at exactly the right spot to get the sound I liked from my new 20 in bass drum. I did some research and discovered several different bass drum lifter products and chose to try the Dixson Bass Drum Lift first as it was the simplest and was very affordable. It took a little time to get setup for best results, and I had to shorten the chain on my pedal in order to get a longer throw, but once I got everything adjusted and tuned up, the results were exactly what I was looking for. My bass drum sound is perfect and the feel of my pedal is ideal for the style of playing I do. What a great product, and super simple to setup.

"In my business I use a lot of high end medium to large diaphram condenser mics. I have several R0DEs including the standard studio omnis and an NT-4 X-Y coincident. I also have Beyer's, AKGs and Studio Projects. For my Nikon D-7000 I decided to try the R0DE SVM, but being concerned about one reviewer's report of not fitting the D-7000 and the channels being reversed I directly contacted R0DE.

R0DE had NO reports of issues with fit on the D-7000 and NO reports on swapped channels. R0DE said that if anyone experienced either of these issues the mic would be considered defective and would be immediately replaced. So I ordered one and here are my results (and I doubt if yours would vary :-) :

1. The mic mount is a perfect fit for the hot shoe on my Nikon D-7000. Lots of adjustment room and a hefty yet easy to use mechanism to tighten it down. Note that there could be a fit issue if you had ANY camera fitted with one of the add-on hot shoe adapters, especially the cheap Chinese knockoffs.

2. The mount and the body of the case is cast metal, built like a miny tank. This added mass helps to isolate the mike capsule through the suspension system. It does add weight to the whole unit, but that is an added advantage in image stabilization. If you want ""light"" in all ways, just do your videos with one of the Flip units.

3. The channels are correct in terms of Left and Right when the R0DE is plugged directly into the Nikon D-7000 microphone plug and the files are opened in a properly configured video editing system (Sony Vegas 10 Pro in my case)

4. The overall ""ruggedness"" of the assembly is seriously professional. If the combination of the R0DE SVM and a Nikon D-7000 are in a situation where they are subject to excessive shock and physical abuse my money on survival would be on the R0DE. . .with 100 to 1 odds!

This is a genuine Stereo mic and is best suited for capturing the ambient sound of video subject matter and backgrounds. Although it could be used to record on-camera talent, capturing that is better suited to either a directional mic on a boom, or a handheld ""interviewer's"" mike or some sort of clipon or body mike.

Now if the D-7000 just had some sort of level indicator (not even a meter!) just to remind me I needed to turn the power switch ON!",4.0

It was a constant hum, whether or not the guitar was connected and unaffected by the volume control setting (so it was particularly annoying for quiet practice at home). Because postage to send it back would have been prohibitive, I did some research and found that other owners have reported the same problem. I am an experienced electronics engineer, so I took a look inside and found that the signal feed between the pre-amp and the power amp is run directly touching the mains power transformer, which I know from experience is bad assembly practice. So, I made a simple aluminium screen and fitted it between the signal cable and the transformer, and the problem is now solved. In my opinion, this is a good electronics design spoiled by incompetent production assembly. It's a great pity, because otherwise it's a good bit of kit.",3.0

"About Mackie in General:

This is my first experience with a Mackie powered speaker, but I've heard nothing but good things about their powered speakers from others who own/use them, and have used several of their mixers over the years, including a 12-channel model that I've been using personally for over ten years.  Their mixers are built like Swiss army knives, and I consider them to be among the best-designed and best-constructed pieces of pro-audio equipment I've ever used, so I generally rate the Mackie brand pretty highly.

Near-Field Monitors:

""Near-field monitors"" are basically miniaturized versions of the cabinet speakers most musicians and other pro-audio users are used to seeing on the floor, facing up toward the musician.  They come in both self-powered and un-amplified versions.  When used on stage, they're typically mounted on a mic stand, but can also be set on the floor like a typical ""wedge,"" on top of a piano, near the director of a choir, etc. ... basically anywhere ""near"" the person(s) needing a small reference monitor or other light-duty sound reinforcement.

This particular product, designed by Mackie (Woodinville, WA, USA) and manufactured in China to Mackie specs, is designed to be a multi-tasking workhorse.  You can use it as described above, or you can use it as a stand alone mini-PA system, e.g., to provide portable audio support for a computer-based slide show/video presentation; small public speaking affairs; mono amplification for an iPod or mp3 player, etc.

Enclosure:

The enclosure is a well-designed combination of polypropylene and steel.  Most of the front, sides and bottom are molded polypropylene.  This stuff has become very common in pro-audio speaker cabinets, because it's lightweight, shock/impact resistant, and practically indestructible.  The JBL Eons use similar materials; I've used them for years and absolutely love them.  The speaker grill is steel, apparently attached to the speaker opening with pressure and/or a bead of silicone adhesive.  The back panel, including the area of the line in/out jacks, power controls, and heat dispersion fins, is all steel.
A carrying handle is built into the top of the enclosure ... as opposed to the screw-on, strap-type carrying handle.  On the bottom of the cabinet is a fitting for mounting the SRM150 on a mic stand.  On the top is another fitting you can use to attach a boom, thus incorporating the SRM150 into a single mic stand assembly.  I personally don't plan to use it that way, but it's nice to know you can if you're so inclined.

Front Panel:

The front panel features three separate inputs:  2 Neutrik ""combo"" inputs that allow use of either a "" instrument plug (balanced or unbalanced), or an XLR microphone plug, and 1 input that accepts the ubiquitous RCA L/R audio plugs.  While this input is ""stereo,"" the amp will obviously combine the R/L stereo feed received at this input into a mono output from the unit's speaker.  Each input has its own dedicated level control, with the ""Main,"" in turn, controlling volume on all three inputs simultaneously.  In short, these controls make the SRM150 a miniature 3-channel powered mixer and PA, complete with 3-band EQ.

The ""instrument"" button modifies the Channel 1 input to allow use of the input with high-impedance signals from instruments with electric pickups.

The ""phantom power"" button sends ""global"" 48v DC phantom power to both of the combo inputs, so there's no problem with using condenser mics or other input devices that require phantom power.

Rear Panel:

The rear panel features another Neutrik ""combo"" input, which can be used to add an external source (e.g., CD playback, feed from another mixer) to the front panel sound sources, or in conjunction with the adjacent XLR ""through"" connector, e.g., if you want to daisy chain the SRM150 with other monitors, or use the SRM150 as a personal monitor/mixer and feed its ""sub-mixed"" output into a larger PA speaker/system.  The mic/line button modifies the output level of the ""through"" jack for the latter use.

The SRM150 uses a plug-in universal power cord, which I LOVE.  My old Galaxy ""Hot Spot"" used a fixed-install power cord that lasted a pretty long time, but inevitably began to fail at the point where it enters the unit, requiring me to repeatedly open up the unit and reinforce the cable with duct tape.

The power supply/amp is protected by a 3-amp circuit-breaker type fuse.

Design, Sound and Power:

While the basic design and function of these near-field monitors hasn't changed much in a long time, the power and technology being packed into them has changed quite a bit.  For example, I started looking at replacements like the SRM150 and Behringer B205D (basically, a Behringer knockoff of the Mackie design) because both input circuits on my old Galaxy Audio ""Hot Spot"" were going bad, and I didn't want to spend the money putting it in the shop, which I'd already done once before, at a cost of about $75.  That self-powered Hot Spot, which could pump 100 watts at 8 ohms (or 140 at 4 ohms) weighs 10.7 lbs.  The Mackie is more powerful; sounds better; has better connection options and features than the Hot Spot, and weighs in at just 7.6 lbs. ... more than 3 lbs. lighter.  That's a weight difference of almost 30%!

The speaker in the Hot Spot is about 4 inches, and it basically sounds like a 4-inch speaker ... connected to a comparatively HUGE amp and driver magnet.  The custom-engineered neodymium speaker in the SRM150 is 5.25 inches, and covers enough dynamic range to sound like a two-way with, say, about an 8-10"" woofer.  I mean, it's definitely small, but it CRANKS a lot ""bigger"" than you'd ever expect from its size.  There is simply no comparison in the sound between the two.  The sound from the Mackie is light years better than the Hot Spot.

The target frequencies of the individual EQ controls are nicely spaced (High: 12kHz; Mid: 2.5kHz and Low: 100Hz, all adjustable to +/- 15dB); very well matched with one another, and equally well-matched with the effective dynamic range of the speaker and amp.  Careful adjustments can yield some really amazing sound quality, depending on the quality of what you're putting in.

The amp/speaker is rated for 100 watts continuous power, with peaks to 150 watts, and I would say the SRM150 gives every bit of that, with very low noise, and crystal clarity.  I tested it by running through a few favorite tunes on my mp3 player, separately trying all three inputs, and it had me dancing all over the house.

A Word About Durability and Warranty Protection:

I read a review on another site that referred to the SRM150 as ""fragile,"" and I have no reason to doubt the author's experience.  While I find no fault with his assessment, I wouldn't call the SRM150 ""fragile.""  I would, however, consider it a pretty specialized piece of PA equipment that probably isn't your best choice, e.g., if it's going to be constantly run at, or near peak volume in competition with much louder/bigger sound sources, bouncing around in the back of a van, getting dropped a lot, or getting hammered by other, larger pieces of equipment when it's being stored and transported.  It sounds, looks and feels to me like it can easily hold up against all the abuse normally associated with, e.g., light acoustic setups, house of worship, home studio reference, parties, video/audio presentations, etc., but not as well in heavier, full band settings/uses.

Mackie warrants this product for 3 years, and 90 days for its ""B-Stock"" factory refurbs.  I got mine as ""B-Stock,"" with a free, 1-year extension of the Mackie warranty from the online vendor I bought it from.  Although the unit I got definitely showed signs of prior use and refurbishing, I found everything to be tight, clean and functioning perfectly.  Sometimes I think you're better off getting something that the manufacturer's QC guys have gone through and tested not just once, but two or three times ... especially when it saves you 20% or more off the price for ""new,"" and you can still get some decent warranty protection.  Only time will tell if I was right about that this time ...

Conclusion:

So far, I couldn't be happier with the SRM150.  It's lightweight, powerful, versatile, looks cool, sounds fantastic and is ridiculously easy to set up and use.  It's a near-field monitor/mini-mixer/PA with that Mackie MOTAH.  Buy with confidence.",5.0

"I use these pickups on a new Shen SB80 double bass. I wedged the pickups into the little heart shaped holes in the bridge. The first problem I encountered was really low output coming from the pickups. The problem is that piezo pickups have pretty low electrical resistance (20K - 40K ohms), and as a result you not only get less desired sound output, but the output you do get is often drowned out by the inherent noise of the instrument itself (think extra loud noise when you bump the bass' body but not so much sound when you pluck a note). The solution was to buy a preamp. I picked up a Behringer ADI21 acoustic preamp to boost the output resistance to over 4 MOHM. This took the majority of the noise out of the sound and increased the output of the pickups for the right sounds. The next issue I encountered was a ground hum, much like one would get with a poorly grounded guitar. What I did to alleviate that problem was take a single strand of copper wire from the shielding of an old instrument cable, and wrapped it around all of the strings between the tail piece and the bridge, grounding them all together. Completely removed the hum. So after some trial and error, I was able to get a great bass sound for very little money (I bought the pickup for ~$22 and the preamp for ~$45). I hope this helps. If anyone has any questions just reply to the comment and I'd be happy to help.",4.0

"I've been looking for this sort of cable to do a bit of experimentation with remote recording of MIDI devices using a laptop without an audio-quality sound card.  But at forty to fifty bucks a pop, it wasn't worth it.  Then I came across this and decided it was worth taking a chance.

Having worked with MIDI for many years, I didn't have the same problems as other folks who have posted reviews, such as mixing up the ""in"" and ""out"" functionality and not using proper software on the computer.  I plugged in the cable, let it go through its driver install procedure, and was immediately recording and playing back MIDI through Reaper.  It would be nice if the cable were longer, but I can work around that.  I've only had it for a short while and haven't had an opportunity to use it very hard, so can't speak to its durability.  But it appears to be solid enough; besides, if it breaks, I can replace it easily enough at this price.

Coming across this item was a nice surprise.",5.0

"I've been using the K701s at work.  The K701s are very comfortable and sound great, but are not good for a cubicle environment due to the open back.  So I finally decided to take the K701s home and use them for drum practice where they wouldn't annoy my cubicle neighbors (and my cubicle neighbors would annoy me less with closed backs), and got the K271mII closed back for work, on the theory that they would probably be pretty equivalent to the (much more expensive) K272.  But side-by-side, the K701s are *much* better than the K271, both in comfort and sound.

This could be because the 272 is not ""broken in"" yet (I have serious doubts about whether the electronics is ""breaking in"", or whether you just get used to whatever you have), or perhaps the sound difference is due to the difference between open and closed backs.

I'm very tempted to return this and pony up the extra $150 for the K272, if it's the closed equivalent to the K701.  Darn it.  If I didn't have the K701 sitting right here, I'd probably be perfectly happy.  Is the 272 the closed equivalent to the open 701/702?",4.0
It does what it says very simple to use. I have just started to play the electric guitar and the electric bass guitar and of course the most important thing about playing a guitar of any kind is proper tuning and this will do the trick. Of course when you have new strings they stretch so you will have to return your instrument several times until the strings are done stretching.,5.0

Obviously you get what pay for. The shipping was very fast! I had to get a replacement and both the original and replacement were delivered the next day.

"I got this amp because I was fascinated that it was a 'clone' of a Marshall 1959 100W plexi, for so much less money.  I also have a 50W Marshall JCM800 2204 that served as a point of comparison .

This amp sounds spectacular, I'm not sure if it's due to having no master volume, but it's just got 'the sound' - beautiful, bright, crunchy Marshall sound.  It's incredibly loud though: I've pulled two of the four power tubes, and use an attenuator to get the volume down.

In switching between the JCM and this amp, I actually found myself -preferring- the Bugera.  Maybe my 800 needs new tubes, but it just didn't have the same huge, glassy, ripping tone as this amp.

I can't comment on it's reliability because I've only had it for few weeks, but tone-wise, it's just an amazing amp.",5.0

The light comes packaged in a cardboard box wrapped in clear plastic film.  Included is the Light, Power Adapter, and User Manual.

The light has a silver metal base and a white plastic cylinder top.  It plugs into your standard two prong wall outlet.  When plugged in there is a steady blue indicator light on the silver base just below the logo.  The light changes between blue and red as well as flashes to let you know the function it is in when changing the lighting source.  I recommend reading through the user manual to familiarize yourself with how to change the lighting features prior to use.

The light illuminates white with three different brightness modes for all uses.  There is a low, medium, and high setting.  The light is operated on touch sensor control only by pressing the silver base.  To change the white lighting modes fast touch until you get your desired brightness.  To turn off use four fast presses.

To switch to the color mode you have to long press for three seconds.  The lights then start to cycle through a beautiful light display with an endless color display.  If you see a color that you like and want the light to stay on you just have to long press on the color and it will stay that color.  It is a relaxing mood lighting to help you unwind at the end of a long day.

This is a really nice bedside light but really could be used in any area of the home as it has a stylish look to it.  My family really enjoys the touch sensor capabilities of the lamp.

It did take a little practice to figure out the right distance to get to that sweet spot where the sound is optimum and while it is close, it's not uncomfortable and for me with the stand, I was able to sit in a proper upright position.

This is probably the Audiobox's strongest area. Almost everything (dials, case, faceplate) is made of very sturdy metal giving it a professional, high quality feel. The dials move in increments rather than continuously, but the increments have always been small enough for me and the movement is smooth and weighty. Everything just feels so well made, unlike the rather flimsy plastic design of the Fast Track Pro. No real issues here.

Internal Hardware:
The headphone amp is pretty good; it works well for low to middle impedance headphones, but anything over about 100 Ohms will likely need a bit more power. Even my 64 Ohm headphones don't go THAT loud (but still pretty loud, I like high volume and have always been happy). The recording and playback quality/capabilities have generally been perfectly satisfactory for a non-pro like me except that it can sometimes add a slight crackle at random times. It's unobtrusive and rare, but annoying if you just had an awesome take that got messed up. However, these kind of issues are to be expected from an entry-level interface. Also, while I have never had issues recording using my Blue Spark Condenser Mic, other reviewers have had issues with some instrument recording. So be sure to read those if that is your thing.

Software/drivers:
As with many audio devices, the drivers are a bit sketchy; I recommend using ASIO4all rather than the native driver. Additionally, I have had issues with it repeatedly freezing my computer on startup if I disconnect it improperly (reconnecting it always fixed this issue). The included Presonus Studio One DAW is great, very user-friendly and powerful. Additionally, the version of Studio One you get is actually quite good. I paid the $100 to upgrade to the Producer version so I could use external VSTs, but many people may find they are perfectly happy with the bundled version.

Conclusion/Final Thoughts:
The Presonus Audiobox USB is a solidly built, powerful USB audio interface. If not for the occasional sound errors and sketchy drivers it would be a fantastic product. Despite these issues, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well-priced, entry-level audio interface but still wants a quality product.",5.0
"Picked up one of these on sale (from Sam Ash, not amazon...sorry).  It is an absolutely great instrument.  Rich, warm tone.  Lots and lots of sound.  Holds a tune for days.  Solid, one-piece wood neck WITH an internal adjusting rod.  It sounds much better, not just a little better, than my $350 Lanikai baritone UkeSB!  Great action and oh so easy to tune, even though the one weak link I would say is the gearing, with tiny little handles.  But for this price, and the sound this baritone puts out, it is still a steal at this price.  Buy a couple so you have an extra around for friends and play duets.  That's twice as good.",5.0

"I bought my 120W Crate guitar amp when I was in high school. It has lasted well over 10 years and still gives plenty of power. This amp offers a nice deep and powerful sound on the clean channel (even if a bit on the arid side when not running through any effects pedals) but the built-in distortion sounds are nothing to write home about - also, and most disappointing, the reverb is basically nonexistent even when cranked all the way up. It goes without saying that you should go tubes if you like a natural sound.

That being said, I think Crate is easily one of best solid-state amps you could find on the market and for a really good price too. If you primarily plug into only one multi-effects pedal (or use a reverb pedal to make-up for the amp's lack of reverb), you don't need anything but the clean channel anyway, and, if you don't care that this amp won't give off quite as warm of a sound that a tube amp does, I think it's safe to say that you'll be very happy with this Crate combo.",5.0
"THIS IS AN UPDATE OF MY PREVIOUS PRODUCT REVIEW: So, after posting my issue with our purchased violin, I received a telephone call within the hour from Kennedy violins.  The representative from Kennedy said that she was not sure why my email went unanswered even though she did see it in the system, but she assured me that they were willing to help resolve the issue.  I have to admit, I was very skeptical.  I felt like after all the time my issue was ignored that I would continue to be ignored, but I was wrong. They sent me a new violin to replace the other one: it was packaged beautifully in a super high quality case.  The sound on the violin is amazing.  My daughter loves playing it and I feel like if she loves the sound, she is going to want to continue to learn and make music.  All I wanted was a quality product that would last until she outgrew it.  They have made good on this issue and I am so thankful.  I am only giving 4 stars because of the original issue I had with the first violin.  The new violin they sent me is out-of-this-world and ideal for my young daughter to learn and grow on.

BUYER BEWARE!!! No kidding, don't buy from this company.  We bought this violin for our daughter who is 4 years old and really wants to learn how to play the violin, and had started playing before she was 3.  We bought the Richard Bunnell G2 Violin in Nov/Dec 2015 time frame to replace a violin we were renting. The violin seemed like it was always having a problem being and staying tuned, then it started making a weird sound. But of course, what do I know, at 4 my daughter isn't exactly a virtuoso, so I expected weird sounds.  After a while, there was no improvement and I had had enough. I took it to the professionals at a notable violin shop in Cleveland to see if it needed new strings or new bridge and right away he said the problem was a warped fingerboard. It took all of 5 seconds to diagnose. He explained that the way the violin was initially constructed was faulty.  It should have been constructed with a concave fingerboard so strings don't touch, but it was not. So, in the parking lot of the violin shop, I immediately called Kennedy violins.  They said no problem send us an email.  I sent an email to their support and I got nothing but crickets.  I think I was a month outside the warranty period from Amazon, but this was no typical problem, it was a manufacture defect and if they stand by their products, it should have been a no brainer.  What kind of company does this sort of thing to kids who are trying to develop a skill, if anything they should make sure the products they produce foster the love of music through quality. Further, to avoid their customers by ignoring them and their communications is also a crappy practice.  Shame on you Kennedy Violins.  I wish I could give negative stars, because they don't even deserve a single one. There are too many other violin companies out there, avoid these guys.",4.0

"I bought this to swap out a fretless neck on a MIM Jazz Bass I've had for years.  I loved playing the fretless, but decided it wasn't getting enough playing time.  This neck swap was completely painless.  The neck dropped in perfectly, no shims and the truss rod only needed about 1/4 turn after loading it up with strings.

"I'm a pedal freak. It's my vise. I buy way too many and half of them I don't need. I'd had this pedal on my radar but never got around to pulling the trigger...mainly because it doesn't ""do"" much. It's not flashy. But out of probably two dozen pedal transactions in 2015, this was without question the best return on investment I've made. It just works perfectly. They obviously spent a lot of time making sure the knobs affected all the right frequencies for guitar. What a concept!

I mainly use this after dirt pedals and before time based stuff to ""reshape"" or ""fine tune"" the EQ. If you have a pedal that you love the way it clips the signal but you wish it had a little less bottom end (for example) this is PERFECT! Also works great as a lead boost. EQ it like a tube screamer, maybe up the level a bit, and off you go. I've also used it with a Fender Pro Jr amp that has just a tone knob (no full EQ). Place this pedal after everything, let it sit on top of the amp, and pretend the amp just got a three band EQ. Genius!

Seriously, just buy it already. They got this one right.",5.0

"Okay, I have been playing alto sax for nearly seven years, now.  I have tried many reed brands, from regular Ricos and Vandorens to random no names. When I heard about this reed being a jazz reed, I was like, well,  what the heck?  When I opened it up, it played brilliantly.  The reed was not airy or scratchy sounding at all.  I use this reed now for all types of playing.  The typical lifespan of one reed, used everyday, is about one month. I rotate my reeds so they last longer, and I still get that new sound whenever I play with these reeds. I have tried this reed with multiple mouthpieces, including the Jody Jazz classical mouthpiece, Selmer 80 and 90, Yamaha 4c, and many other mouth pieces.",5.0
"At first use, it was working like a 5 star products with my Apple TV (small puck size). But when I had to use it again. The lid that covers the optical connection on this device broke off.

It was possible for me to put the grey cover back in place, but once you remove the optical cable. That grey cover will fly off with it. Permanently gluing this to the open position won't work since the cover works in a lever action that when you pull the optical cable out, the cover is also pulled to close the connection. I will have to return this item.

Just as a note, I've been using this style of strap lock for years, both Schaller and Fender. This is the first time I've ever found a pair that didn't work properly. I did call Fender though, and they said there was a problem with some of the buttons, so they're sending me a new set.",1.0

They had to be tightened up every time she played it for at least a week.  They are nylon and not great quality.  You can buy new strings and replace them if this bothers you but she just worked with it and now it's always good to go with just minimal re-tuning.

"The cheapest guitar you've ever played was put together with more care than this little guy, but that doesn't mean it can't sound great if you put a little extra care into it yourself.
First off, ukulele strings take some time to stretch out, so expect to keep re-tuning for about a week before they settle in. No skipping this process, even on $1000 dollar ukuleles.
Second, It's a cheap ukulele, so the action is going to be very high at the saddle and the nut, plus the fret board will not be level. This is what is making your ukulele sound like an alley full of deaf cats. When the action is too high, you have to stretch the strings to play a note, making it too sharp. They make the action high so that you don't notice the buzzing created by the uneven fret board.
The good news is, you can lower the action and level the fret board at home really easily. Rather than go through the process here, just spend some time googling ""ukulele setup"". There are a lot of good tutorials out there. Some guys use specialized files for the nut and fret board, but you don't necessarily need to go spending money on new tools. I've found you can just attach some high-grit sandpaper to a flat sanding block, and that works great for leveling the frets and bringing down the saddle. Also, a welding tip cleaner works perfectly for filing down the nut and you can grab one at any hardware store for 4 bucks.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hobart-770085-Welding-Oxy-Acetylene-Tip-Cleaner-Large/dp/B0017Z04Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hobart 770085 Welding Oxy-Acetylene Tip Cleaner - Large</a>

"This program has lots of support options: videos, forums, FAQs, chat lines and a 300 page (fine print) manual. You will need all of them. If one monster program was not enough, they send you two. The second one is called RealBands and it has an entirely different user interface and, according to one forum respondent, it's more difficult than the first program. The backing tracks sound no better than a cheap midi keyboard so you'll want to use their RealTracks, but they apparently do not get installed during setup, so support send me a link to a video where they guy show how easy it is to select one from a list, but none of mine are installed. I do a browser search for ""how to install Band in a Box realtracks."" and get their support page saying: ""This tutorial is mainly intended for customers who purchased the UltraPlusPAK or EverythingPAK using the download-only option."" I have not purchased either of those packages. So I look at the next support page which has 32 FAQs, none of them telling me how to install realtracks.

I look at the third support page and I get this:

-------------------------------------------------------------

To find out which RealTracks Sets you have installed, on the Windows version you can go to the Help menu in Band-in-a-Box and click on What add-ons do I have? On the Mac version, you can go to the MIDI menu | What add-ons do I have?

To find out which RealTracks styles (instruments) you have installed, open the 'Assign RealTracks to Track' dialog in Band-in-a-Box by right-clicking (or Control-clicking on the Mac) on a track in the instrument panel at the top of the screen and selecting 'Add/Remove RealTracks' (or 'Choose RealTracks' on the Mac). You should have Band-in-a-Box 2008 Build 259 or higher, otherwise you won't have the 'Assign RealTracks to Track' dialog. This dialog will show you all of your currently installed RealTracks, and you can also select the 'Show RealTracks that are N/A (not available)' checkbox to see any RealTracks styles that you don't have. In Band-in-a-Box 2009 and higher, the Assign RealTracks dialog will also tell you which RealTracks Set each style is from, and you can sort by Set# by clicking at the top of that column.

Below is a list of the RealTracks styles included in each set.

Note: There are some RealTracks styles that have variations, in which each variation uses material from the same audio source files, but follows different parameters when choosing phrases from the files. One example is ""Guitar, Electric, Soloist Metal Wild Ev 120"", which has 'blisteringly fast' phrases, and ""Guitar, Electric, Soloist Metal Wild Ev 120 (SemiWild)"", which has slightly slower phrases. The variations are listed in parentheses after the style name.

Between all 3 the Amp & Mode selections sounded the same. The Low-High on the TM300 & the Bass-Treble on the GDI21 affect the same range the same amount. The amp was different because of it's 3-Band EQ.

The Drive Effect on both Pedals sound the same. The Level Output on both Pedals put out the same.

At this point it looks like the TM300 is just the guts of the GDI21 placed into a Heavy Plastic stomp-box case. It is only missing the XLR out of the GDI21.

BUT the TM300 is a LOT noisier than the GDI21 by about 8db! This was with batteries, the Behringer Power Supply, and 2 other Power supplies No matter what we tried, the TM300 was flat out noticeably more ""hissy"", with a low end hum in the 100hz area.

From a durability stand point, both pedals are plastic, but the TM300 feels like it could with stand live gigging in a floor board a LOT better than the GDI21.

And we both suggest that the person who designed the battery compartment on the TM300 pedal be shot!! This holds true of ALL of this series of pedals, I own the AM300 and it is the same way.

So, is it worth getting? It depends. For recording we would say no, it is too noisy for this. Grab the GDI21 for recording. For Live Playing the noise is not an issue when used with other pedals & an amp, so it is a great deal for that. If you are also running Direct to the PA, we feel the GDI21 is the way to go for 3 reasons, the Balanced XLR out, the ability to use it as a ""splitter"", running the XLR to FOH & the 1/4"" to you stage amp, and the noise level.

We are both Behringer fans, and have been for over a decade. We feel that their line of V-Tone Modeling Amps & Pedals are the BEST deal out there for great tones on a budget. I am still amazed at how well my beat up GM108 sounds live, or mic'd for recording. And when you use it as a ""head"" for a 10"" or 12"" cab it just gets better.

Hope this helps!",4.0

"Simply amazing....right out of the box these monitors sound awesome!!! The bass is very present especially when you crank the volume...which gets surprisingly loud. The highs are very crisp and clean. The speakers aren't even broken in yet and I am very impressed by their performance. I can't wait to hear them 50 hours of use later when the powerful Bass gets even more punchy. I am going to be using these for living room speakers used for entertainment like movies, video games, and music in an apartment. I am a little sceptical about the amount of power these speakers generate when I think of how disturbing they might be to the neighbors....not a bad problem to have!!!! There is so much quality put into this product... it is surprising. The reason I say this is because for about $50 dollars less than this set of speakers I had tried another set from another brand: the arion legacy ar60. They were about half the size as these and a tenth of the quality in sound and hardware. So for the price....these rockville 8"" monitors are an absolute steal seeing as they were retailed at $450 originally...and you can't even find them on the their website.",5.0

"To start I will subdivide this into a couple parts so each component gets a proper review:

Microphone: The Neewer NW-700 has a great cardiod pickup. Unfortunately as explained in the description and FAQ this microphone will not work with my laptop (MacBook) although works quietly (as mentioned in FAQ) on my PC and Laptop (Dell). I took their recommended setup and purchased a XLR inline power couple to avoid this. As for audio quality this microphone was only very slightly lesser quality than my studio quality ""Blue Yeti Pro"", this difference was barley noticeable though and is considered by myself as a moot point.

Stand / Mic Clips: The stand has a great build quality and strong locks. I find the knobs very easily manipulated and positions lock nice and tight without slippage. One thing that is not stressed with the description is that not only are 3 mic clips included but there is a threading both vertical and on the boom arm. This meaning that you can mount a microphone on the tip of the vertical stand where it holds the boom, as well as on the boom. I actually used one of the 3 mic clips to hold my webcam in my office then used the boom to hold the mic its self.

Pop Filter / Wind Screen: The windscreen included works quite well with a nice stretchy durable foam. I want to stress the stretch as this windscreen also fits my other studio microphone which is almost 2x the diameter. As for the pop filter, this is the only piece that I have any quarrel with. It is very thin as compared to my others and does not provide that much of pop protection, this said it does have a very sturdy mount (in which 1/2 of my others lack... they fall as soon as I clip them on.)

Although I received this product for a reduced or free price in exchange for an honest review, I would happily have paid full price as the quality stands greater that many others in a similar price range.

Please check my profile for more honest reviews like this one!",5.0

It is designed to work as a tabletop piece or as a mic stand attachment.  As my video shows, this works much better for tabletop use than with a mic stand due to the forward-heavy design that puts too much weight out in front of the stand and pulls it over.

"Excellent sounding pickups!! I build custom Les Pauls using stripped Gibson bodies, I just finished a 2015 cherry red LPM using these with 525k pots and orange drop caps. I'm using a real Bigsby and D'Addario NYXL 10's running through a Madison Divinity II amplifier and the sound is tremendous, my hats off to Seymour Duncan for this pickup, since it's not wax potted you can expect some feedback at high over drive but you really can't beat the vintage look or sound of this amazing pickup. If it's pure vintage tone you want drop a set of these in your guitar and you won't believe your ears. So far this beats out even my 59 VOS for sound quality and tone, just remember that if you are putting them into an epiphone get a good set of pots and caps.",5.0

"I wanted to experiment with home recording using my computer.  After a lot of reading of reviews and techniques, I decided to give these mics a try because they appeared to provide the best value.  Overall I think the sound is pretty good, but as one other reviewer noted, it can be distorted easily and thus requires getting everything ""just right"".  I used them to record classical guitar, and found that using the low cut switch reduced the distortion.  I used the eq effect in Audacity to add some bass back into the mix.  As others have noted, you need phantom power.  For that I used the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ART-USB-Dual-Pre-2-Channel-Preamp/dp/B002KEAT78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ART USB Dual Pre 2 Channel Preamp</a>&nbsp;to power the mics and interface with the computer.

"This is my second Odyssey case and I wouldn't go any other way.  As a mobile DJ, your gear can come into the occasional bump or knock.  The solid construction of this case makes me not worry about the gear inside.  I have plenty of room on the top for my mixer, 1 unit light controller, and CD controller with the bottom having room for my amp, CD player, power conditioner, microphones, and some room to spare.  The bottom of the case does have a hole for cords to come out in the rear but I find it is easier to remove the back panel and have my cords come out there.  It will also help with airflow if you want to keep your equipment cool.  The case is a bit on the heavy side and that's why I went with 4 rather than 5 stars and it's helpful to have another person with you to lift the box or carry it if you don't have a dolly.",4.0

I use 2 pair,  which is not necessary but it is fun, (That's what retirement is for) You can go through all the specs you want, bottom line is they're transparent. Great buy for monitors or book shelf speakers. Heck, they're cheap enough, use them for everyday computer speakers.....You're worth it!",5.0
"A friend of mine who is a recording engineer recommended I get this one to go with a Technics turntable (sl-5 linear tracking, p mount only) rather than the Shure someone had put on it. I was hesitant because of the lack of reviews online and the price point. I thought it was too cheap to be really good. I have to say its the best thing I could've gotten. My main musical interest is rock, and some of it gets really hard and heavy. This cartridge makes music really come alive. The bass is full, without overpowering, all of the musical details are crisp and clean. Its dynamic, warm, spacious, vibrant! I haven't felt vinyl in a long time. I could totally feel it with this. I just can't believe that its so underrated. Well, maybe that keeps it nice and affordable.",5.0
"Have to agree with other reviews, the kit should have come with a template.

I chose to install it on my old Yamaha acoustic. I installed the unit by first masking the guitar with painters tape. Measured out the best I could the placement of the pre amp and battery holder. Using the side of the guitar I found the best placement for the pre amp by lining it up until the curve of the guitar lined flush with the curve of the pre-amp. Cut my holes using a dremmel with a cut off wheel. Unfortunately the pre-amp hole was a few millimeters too big, so two of the screws cannot be screwed in, I'll have to find a solution to that in the future. The battery holder hole was perfect, all screws made contact with wood. Install looked clean and was good.

Here's where I got stupid. I didn't understand where the sticky plastic thing was supposed to go, or what it was for. So I zip tied to piezo pick-up to it and stuck on the inside of the sound board. When I plugged it in to my PA it of course sounded like poo. I thought the whole unit was a piece of junk, or I thought I might have cracked the ceramic.

After a little research on you tube I discovered the piezo pick-up is an under-saddle pickup. It needs to be mounted under the saddle in the slot on the bridge. I ground down a few millimeteres in the slot, drilled an 1/8"" hole on the top part of the saddle slot and restrung the guitar and violla! It sounded incredible! I almost prefer the sound of this guitar over my $400 electric acoustic Dean. The highs are crisp and clear, this pick up can be turned very very loud before feedback. I'm just in awe by how good it sounds.

Over all install was about an hour.",5.0

"I received this and was blown away by it. It works great, uses regular AAA batteries instead of those expensive ""coin"" batteries, and you can plug it in to an outlet!

"I wouldn't recommend this device for standard recording (meetings, note-taking, etc.)

When it comes to features, this device is one step above your ""standard"" recorders. It has record-quality selection, mono or stereo, etc.

For most common uses, the disadvantages will probably stand out more than the advantages. Some of the disadvantages of this device are:

- Start-up time required (you will need to wait several seconds before this device powers on and can begin recording).
- If you leave this device on (just the display one without recording), you will find that your batteries will disappear very soon.
- Even with auto-off / stand-by / ""sleep-mode"" turned on, you will find that this recorder goes through batteries much, much faster than other recorders.
- Build quality is mediocre.

For recordings where you don't need stereo sound, I would recommend something like the Olympus VN-702PC (it is much more efficient on battery use and will power on much faster from its stand-by or ""sleep-mode"".",3.0

"I'm the bassist and vocalist in a weekend band and absolutely HATE music stands on a stage. However there are still times when it's helpful to have words in front of me while playing. I also have a real time beat meter on my iPad that we use a lot just to make sure tempos don't run away from us. I used to have a clip on stand and this little gizmo beats that one hands down and I'm pretty sure it's priced a little better than the old one. Fits nicely in my gear bag with all my wires.

One concern that I have always had about these types of stands is that they don't fit survivor cases. I had a survivor case for many years since the iPad would be sitting on my regular clip on stand / music holder. Can't count the number of times some drunk knocked into my stand and onto the floor the iPad would go. So I removed the iPad from it's survivor case and went back to a soft one I had. This works perfect and holds everything very secure.

Construction is always a concern. Being a musician in a bar environment and tearing down after each show takes its toll on anything and everything. This unit is high density plastic where it makes sense and has brass fittings where needed.

One of the really cool features is that it comes with two adjuster sets. One for larger tablets and another for phones.",5.0

This is my second Snark tuner in the past year.  The first one just abruptly quick working with no reason and even with a new battery would not turn back on. The idea of having my tuner clamped to my instrument works well for me because I can retune quickly between songs without needing to look for my tuner.  So I ordered another one.  The tuner was super loose and wouldn't stay on the clamp.  It just keeps falling off and even with being as careful as I can after a week of using it  one of the tabs fell off.  Now I can't clamp it to my instrument and retune quickly without having to search in my case for the tuner.,1.0

"Like many others i have found the gauge of these strings to be ideal, they still bend well enough i can get nice full, solid bass notes and nice clear trebles, a nicely balanced set, with plenty of volume without too much tension. If you still want a string rattle for some reason you can still get it if you hit them hard enough. i kind of prefer Martin strings on most guitars usually as well for some reason. i do however wish dearly they would make Lifespan strings in this gauge as well.",5.0

"The first one was purchased as a Christmas gift so imagine the disappointment to find it was cracked with no packing protection for the front of the guitar. It would have been beautiful if it wasn't cracked and falling apart. I tried to get a replacement, but even though I selected both the guitar and box were damaged upon arrival, I got the message that ""unless the product is damaged upon arrival, we do not offer replacements"". I don't know why they have a check box if it clearly doesn't lead to the right result. So I had to return the entire kit and start over, hoping the lack of packaging protection was just a Christmas debacle, but the second one also arrived without any packing protection on the front of the guitar and some missing plastic protection as well. Box was also damaged, just exactly like the first one because if there is nothing to protect the hardware on the front of the guitar it presses through the box in exactly the same spots. Strangely enough there was packing protecting the back of the guitar where there are no knobs...The guitar works, the amplifier feedback is rather obnoxious, but I do not want to have to go through the same scenario to probably get exactly the same thing. I don't think this company really cares about their product and apparently whoever is shipping out this product is an imbecile.",2.0

"I love this little thing. I originally bought this same model at a folk festival type thing and loved every second i spent with it. Sadly, the old one was lost on a camping trip. Found this one on Amazon with Prime Shipping and snatched it up as soon as i could.

The Jaw harp is small and light, which is disheartening at first, but the tone and playability of it is second to none in this price range.  Being so light and thin makes the resonance in your mouth amplify more than any other Harp i have played. Hands down if you want to pick up a small easy to learn instrument, or add some flair to your music, BUY THIS JAW HARP.",5.0
"Let me start this review by saying that I did not purchase it new.  I traded one of my favorite guitars + a little cash for it.  I have been playing more solo gigs of late so I figured this was perfect for me.  I made arrangements to pick up this unit on my way to a gig since the guy lived about a mile from the bar I was playing at that night.  I plugged it in, ran a mic and my guitar through it and it sounded fine.  I have to admit, for the price it fetches, I was expecting a little higher quality sound but I decided to make the swap.  Anyhow, I played my gig that night with the Fishman and I was a little disappointed.  I asked people in the bar how it sounded and they all seemed to like it.  I discovered the next day after reading some reviews that this unit should be placed several feet away from the performer.  Otherwise, it sounds a bit muddy.  This is where I have a problem with it.  Most places I play offer small space to set up, therefore I don't always have the luxury to place the unit several feet away.  I also recently used it as a monitor for my band and they loved it.  We've had some feedback issues with our floor monitors in the past so this was a nice addition to the band sound, but for $1000, that's quite an expensive monitor.  For my acoustic gigs I use a Samson expedition 308 portable mixer and in my opinion it sounds better than the Fishman.  It also costs about half as much.  I tried out a new Fishman Solo Amp at a Guitar Center recently and this one sounded better than mine.  Doesn't everything sound better in a music store though?  Then u get home and you're like, ehh.  I have to say that I'm not sure if I would purchase another one of these if I were in need of a small p.a.  Check out The Samson first.  It sounds as good, if not better, it has 4 channels (as opposed to 2 w/ Fishman) and it costs a whole lot less.",3.0

"TL;DR - Get this if you are a minimalist pedal user like me. Lightweight, durable, and easy to carry around even when loaded.

Here's a quick review:

Construction: Durable and insanely light thanks to the aluminum material. Everything is welded so it's rock solid. Comes with everything you need right out of the box including Velcro, zip-ties, and brackets to mount a voodoo labs power supply.

Size/Capacity: This is actually smaller than it looks. To put it in perspective I'll say that it can comfortably fit 6 Boss sized pedals (imagine 2 rows of 3 Boss DD-6 Delay pedals and add breathing room to them and you'll get the idea) and a volume pedal. Still though, for being able to fit 6 small pedals this thing is a dream come true for minimalists like myself.

Mobility: The carrying case adds little weight to it and is very comfortable to carry one-handed. I loaded my Pedaltrain with 4 pedals, a volume pedal, and a power supply, then placed it in the carrying case along with two 10' guitar cables, a tuner, and a Rode NT1A condenser mic. The weight was nothing and having all of that in one compact case was highly efficient.",5.0

"I use these, and ONLY these strings on my Fender Hot Rod, Acoustic / Electric Guitar..!  I am a working musician and I have been playing for over 30 years.! I have tried a lot of other strings, and I stopped looking for the ""best strings"", when I found these. They are, in my opinion, the best strings for the money, period.!  Yes, you can pay more for strings, but you DON'T get more. When you change strings as much as I do, and as much as most working musicians do, then you are just flushing your money down the drain when you buy the more costly strings.. Why waste the money..?

"This is a very useful pedal for getting those cool notched wah tones without having to fumble with the treadle on a standard wah, or worry about your setting getting knocked out of place. Also, unlike a regular wah, the Sweet Spot has a mix control that lets you blend in as much (or as little) of the dry signal as you desire. This feature greatly adds to this pedal's flexibility and allows you to use a notched wah tone in more of a subtle way where it helps you cut through the mix without drastically altering your basic sound. The choice of three different wah tones (normal, classic and bass) is the icing on the cake.

I prefer to use this pedal before overdrive, distortion or fuzz. However, you can achieve different tones and textures by placing it after your dirt pedals, just as you can with a standard wah. The only potentially useful thing missing here is a level control. However, most wah pedals don't have a level control, either.

Build quality is very good. This is a solid pedal. Internally, the parts appear to be of high quality. There is a 3PDT switch for true bypass switching, standard sized components (not those microscopic surface mount things) and an actual inductor like the ones used in standard wah pedals. As with MXR and many of the EHX stomp boxes, you have to remove the bottom plate to change the 9V battery.

This is a very cool and unique stomp box that can be the ideal secret weapon for lead tones. If you dig Bowie and Mick Ronson, as I do, then you really have to get one of these! It's right next to my Vox Wah on my board and is employed often.",5.0

"I love this singing bowl & use it regularly for sacred purposes. I'm not sure why some people complain theirs won't sing, they must be doing it wrong because mine worked on the first try & ive never had a problem with it ""not singing."" I usually place the bowl directly on my hand, but just yesterday I held the pillow in my hand with the bowl on top & I was absolutely shocked at how long the bowl continued to sing after I stopped ringing it/circling it with the wand/whatever you call that (it was like magic!). To clarify: you hold the leather part of the wand, use the wooden part to sing the bowl. The wand is held similar to how you would hold a pencil. I keep my eyes on it the first minute or two, until my hand memorized the angle & movement. After that I close my eyes & meditate while playing it for ten minutes or more at a time. The sound is very calming & spiritually peaceful. I also use the sound to charge my crystals & gemstones. I purchased the brown one with the red pillow & im very happy. Keep your eye on the price of these, which fluctuates daily like the stock market (insert eyes rolling emoji here). I purchased when it was down to $34.99, but over a three week period I watched the price go as high as $42, which would be a rip off considering the next day it would go down to $37.

"So I'm not, by any means, an expert on ukuleles, but i think I can tell quality materials when I see it.  I started with a Kala that I purchased at a local music store.  I had fun with it, so I decided to get a concert size.  Didn't want to spend a lot on it, because i'm just starting, so based on the reviews, I purchased this one.  First, delivery was a mess.  It was supposed to be prime 2 day, but it didn't come until the 4th day.  When it arrived, there was a crack down the front.  Amazon replaced it... had to wait a few more days.  The next one came.  It looked okay.  Then the tuner stopped working after about 3 hours of use.  I had another tuner, so I decided to just deal with it.  I changed the strings because they just didn't sound right.  The description said Aquila strings, but I just don't know.  Something was off.  It sounded fine when I switched to Strings that I knew were genuine.  Something I noticed on the first ukulele, was that it had a vibrating noise on the C string, and only the C string.  I thought maybe it was because I was doing something... Maybe it was the crack?  So back to the crack... I returned the first one for a crack.  Now the second one has developed a crack right down the middle.  It looks as though the front panel was 2 equal sides glued together.

bought this for my two year old for christmas. He loves drums so much that we figured we would try out this small one first. It was the perfect size for him. and a great starter! we didn't worry if he messed it up in any way because of the price and the material you really cant complain.

"I bought the AmpKit Link to use with AmpKit and AmpliTube.  It worked great...for about a month.  New batteries, no luck.  All get now is a green light when I plugin, but no sound.  The iPhone app shows no signal being delivered to the app.  I would've just considered mine a lemon (that happens sometimes) and given this a better rating, but the same thing happened to a friends AmpKit Link.  When he took his apart he found a decent board, but the battery and guitar connectors looked like they were hand soldered by a monkey and the solder connections had broken free.  The circuit board was damaged where the connectors had been soldered and looked as though the soldering gun was too hot.

When I took mine apart I saw the same poor hand solder job, but at least the connections were still holding.  So my problem lies else where in the device.  I won't try another AmpKit Link due to the poor quality.  I guess I'll give the iRig a try though I've heard stories of poor quality there too.",1.0
"Pretty simple operation, and it works like it's supposed to so there's no reason to give it anything less.  Boss is known to make indestructible pedals (knock on wood), and it gives you that extreme ""liquid"" like sound, or just a slight chime to your tone, and everything in between depending on how you dial it.  It makes all the difference between a good clean tone and an otherwise weak clean tone on a non-Fender amp that's generally used for crunch/distortion rather than cleaner tones.  Great pedal.",5.0

"We bought this instrument for our daughter.  Teacher never told us that one certain note would not play on it.  She figured that since she would not be playing that note until an older age, it would be ok.  Wish she would have spoke up, because we probably could have gotten it replaced!!!  Well, we ended up having to buy a new instrument, because now she needed an instrument that plays all the notes.  GO FIGURE.  Looking at this instrument, it clearly is warped.  The neck of the instrument has a bend/twist to it and the one f hole has one side going flat, while the other is rounded.  I had the local instrument store look it over.  I was told that this was a very poorly made instrument and that it could have happened over time, but the music teacher confirmed it was always like that.  So now we have an instrument that plays all the notes but one.  It would not be an easy fix, a luthier would have to remove the neck and perhaps even replace the neck.

"Easy to install and easy to use.  While I wouldn't call this a required item for an electric guitar, it does hold straps securely in place by means of ball bearings which securely slide into a groove in the mounting pin.  I feel much more secure with this system that an eyelet of my guitar strap will not suddenly slip from one of the mounts on the instrument.

Installation was not without some work, as one of the mounting pins would not adequately secure itself as the screw chewed through the wood.  Wood glue, masking tape and 12 hours of curing time fixed that little problem and the pin is now secure in the guitar.  Worse case, one could use epoxy to glue it in, or fill the original screw hole and drill a new one.  Using screws of different widths is not advisabe, as they will not consistently seat within the mounting pin, blocking the strap lock from engaging.",5.0
"Absolutely love this pickup! Install was a breeze. I installed in a Recording Kind Dirty Thirties RPH-05 single O sized guitar. I was a little shy at first about installing a pickup that costs half as much as the guitar in this thing, but it sounds so good and so true to the unplugged sound of the guitar! Installation is really easy with the included template pieces. Make sure you get the GEL super glue and not regular, as the gel gives you enough time to place the pickup pieces before it dries. I also highly recommend finding some sort of wooden or plastic dowel that fits into a 1/4"" guitar jack to aid in threading the jack through the inside of the guitar to the hole to mount it. Made life much easier for me with that. Seriously couldn't be easier to install a pickup myself than this thing. Worth every penny.",5.0

Now my keyboard playing can be much louder and richer, though it seems the really low tones and bass reverb a bit too much, maybe that's just the effect I had on or I should have turned it down in the keyboard's settings.  But overall I like this amp, it's cool to have and I'm sure I can compete with the volume of friends now that I have an amp rather rather than built-in keyboard speakers.",4.0

"My son bought it to help with his guitar studies.  The install went well in Windows Vista.  The program does have a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it is not too terribly hard to use.  The one thing that I do not like is the sounds.  Most are cheap synth sounds unless you buy the 'real band' sounds to work with this program.  There are some that come with the program, but their number is limited.  Granted, my son is using the onboard sound in his pc, so that may have an affect on the sound quality, but that still doesn't eliminate the need to buy any extra sounds-especially if you want rock sounds.

My son has had it for awhile, and does use it.  But he does say that in hindsight, he wouldn't have made this purchase, had he known more about the product.",3.0

"After decades of experience with music production I have now landed on Reason 7 as my final destination for audio and music production. With the latest upgrade to version 7 Propellerhead Software has matured Reason to the point where I have no more requests. For years before this Reason alone was not capable of doing all that I needed; maybe 7 is a lucky number. Windows and Mac users are very lucky to have such a powerful tool available. In summary, Reason 7 is a complete music composition and recording system.

The more I learn about Reason's built-in mixing capabilities the more I am convinced that a big time ""SSL 9000k"" mixing desk is inside my Asus laptop. Tiny, and enormous all at once! I am shaking in my boots! So, onto the features.

The incredible technology of Propellerhead Software's Recycle has now been properly incorporated into Reason itself. It is no longer needed to leave Reason, go into Recycle to create .rex files, then go back to Reason; Reason now elegantly detects transients and creates slices! Sending freshly sliced audio directly into a Rex module has also been made simple and easy, streamlining workflow in a major way. Adding to this stunning feature is Audio Quantizing which could be used for all types of purposes. Reason will record, slice, and quantize all in one breath! *Infomercial Needed Here!

Reason 7 now supports external Midi hardware. This is a feature many Reason users have been requesting for a long time. Owners of EMU samplers and other retro hardware have an interest in triggering these devices and/or sending their audio back into Reason after being triggered by this new Midi support.

The new Spectrum Analyzer continues on Reason's current course towards emulating big-studio environments. Reason users have already been celebrating the SSL 9000k emulation and people like me are learning the SSL 9000k for the first time, within Reason! This new Spectrum Analyzer is yet another step in this direction, giving users a visual EQ that is quickly becoming the favorite ""go-to"" choice. Reason 7 also enhances this compelling 'virtual' SSL mixing desk with built-in support for parallel compression (aka ""New York"" style) while making bussing and grouping easier than ever. The YouTube video by James Wiltshire shows this jaw-dropping emulation in action.

Reason 7 features an improved sound bank, building on the already enormous sound bank that comes with Reason. An ""Audiomatic Retro Transformer"" effect is also included to sweeten the deal. The included presets, such as Tape, VHS, vinyl, make this a useful, fun, and retro style effect.

If you are brand new to making music with a computer Reason 7 is such a complete and mind blowing system it would be hard for me to recommend anything else. While Reason does not support the industry standard VST plug-ins it offers its own version of this called Rack Extensions. These purchasable (and sometimes free) add-ons give producers access to a wide array of fresh effects and instruments. For example, the Radical Piano Rack Extension ($99) can be used with a full and half compatible dampening sustain pedal such as the Roland DP-10 ($34.99), offering possibly the most dynamic, sensitive, wonderful sounding simulated piano in existence. Pair this with a $200 semi-weighted 88 key controller keyboard and you have a startlingly real grand piano in your apartment with the touching subtle nuances of a real piano, and it never goes out of tune.

The total price tag for a system like this remains so low there is a reason to celebrate. Reason 7 allows the gap between technology and production to become thinner and it can be an amazing conduit for musicians' raw creativity. Reason 7 is well worth buying and learning.",5.0

"Most of my Soultone rides are about 100 grams or less per inch. This one, though, weighed in at 3357 grams or approximately 146 grams per inch. Despite the weight, it plays like a much lighter ride.

One striking characteristic is the amount of wash. If you are not careful it will go into a roar, so controlling it takes some practice. Even after you become accustomed to it, there are still over- and undertones, so the diminished stick definition is not what one expects from a flat ride.

Another interesting characteristic is despite the weight the edges wobble when you lay into it. Compared to my 19"" Soultone Custom Flat Ride this one has a much lower fundamental (expected), but is a lot more lively than the smaller model.

Like all of the Soultone rides that I own (eight to date), this one is really not designed for loudly amplified music. It will work well in a jazz piano trio, and is loud enough to cut through some lightly amplified music such as electric blues (at sane volumes), country and roots. I think the wash on this cymbal makes it somewhat one dimensional outside of acoustic jazz, though. Since that is primarily the music I play I gave it five stars. If you play some other genre of music I recommend that you try one of these in person before plunking down bucks.",5.0

"This was my first Ukulele (I play piano & guitar). I am extremely pleased and delighted with this little instrument. It has a clear, bright sound. It is well constructed and the Aquila strings are a nice feature.  A few of the other reviews mentioned trouble with the tuner.  I wasn't worried because I have many other tuning options, but mine works great. The bag was nicer than I expected. It is a soft case, but has some padding and a convenient pocket on the front. I figured that I would order this instrument as an experiment and then upgrade if I became proficient enough. However, I don't even see a need to upgrade. This was a great find!",5.0
"EDIT: Updating after much use.  This bag is not very useful.  Zippers are cheap.  As mentioned below making pockets not very useful.  The large pocket won't even let me put a standard 1"" binder with my music in it.  Inside the support for under the neck is goofy and weak.  The whole bag always wants to collapse.  I have other great bags which simply don't do this.  There is not enough storage pockets for my basic needs. I'm replacing this thing.  You get what you pay for and this buy has not panned out.
---
Initial use about a week in using it sparingly.  Seems OK but trying to work out the kinks, literally in the case which came with it being stuffed in a shipping box.  Initially seems to have plenty of storage but stuff like the top long pocket is not very useful.  It should have 2 zippers meeting at the top rather than one which you have to pull all the way up and then all the way down the other side.  It does not work easily one handed.  I like it and will check back in a few months.  For the money it was by far the best I could find and I'm not disappointed.",2.0

"I just got this Behringer U-Phono to transfer microcassettes to digital files.  I plugged my microcassette recorder into the unit, using a 3.5mm to 2RCA Stereo Audio Cable, purchased separately, then plugged the U-Phono into my computer.  I am not a sound expert, and the original tapes were not created under ideal sound circumstances, but this seems to be good enough quality for my purposes (and likely I will be able to enhance the sound a little more once the tapes are digitized).  I opted for the Behringer U-Phono UFO202 over the UCA222 and UCA202 because this one has a switch from line to phono, in case I opt to transfer some records, too.  I had a little trouble with Audacity initially (which is what I opted to download based on other reviews).  I saw the sound visibly, but couldn't get sound to play from the computer. I think it defaulted to playing the sound out of the U-Phono. I had to modify my preferences and change the sound back to the computer speakers. I wonder if this happened to some of the other reviewers who reported difficulty getting the unit to work?  So, perhaps not the most intuitive device, but I'm very happy to have it and overall pleased.",4.0

I purchased this preamp about 6 months ago.  It is true that it makes your instrument warm and fat.  If you are happy with this one feature then buty it.  But this pretty much only occurs in low gain position.  In high gain there are lots of tube whistling noises etc.  So what I am trying to say is this is a rookie design and it should be left to the pros.  Not worth the money because it is poorly designed.  Inputs and outputs were mislabled and just bad workmanship.  Don't let this company BS you.  Buy from a proven company with lots of reviews.  Sorry for negative review but I just don't want anyone else to get burned.,2.0
"It's a great stand for the price. I've seen similar models sell for $20 or $30 in stores. It's light weight but also pretty sturdy. It gets the job done. My only complaint is that the bottom piece that holds the guitar swivels... I'm not sure what the point of that is... it's not a big deal, I just don't really understand why it's not stationary. I bought the stand for use in my house because I was leaning my guitars against the walls and they'd always somehow fall over and get scratched or hit something... so if you're wanting it for gigs, I can't tell you how well it'd work for on-stage... but my guess is that it'd be fine. :)",5.0
I bought a set of Mapex drums for my son and he was upset because they didn't sound as good as the set that his teacher had in the studio.

The Power Supply fits and works with no problems. The Headphones do fit in the jack in the Yamaha with the supplied adapter and works fine. The stand is a generic stand but I have used it with no problems. Although this keyboard does not have Touch Response or weighted keys, it is a good start to determine if you will really enjoy playing the piano and will stick with it. After a couple years and you are still playing and enjoy it, then it will be time to spend the extra money for something more professional and you will have your Yamaha YPT 230 as a spare to take anywhere. I wouldn't waste money on a more expensive keyboard until you are sure you are going to stick with it. You will have plenty to learn and can play many songs with this one first.",5.0

"This amp is an amazing value for the price. I am using it currently in my living room driving a pair of custom made speakers, and it sounds incredible. It arrived well packaged. It was marked all over ""Heavy"" and ""Handle with Care- Heavy"". It weighs about 40 pounds. Everything looked great when I got it. It was double boxed, which was good, as it had to travel all the way up here to Alaska. Plus the shipping was free, nice. Initial inspection found everything ok, nothing broken. You DO have to pop out the plugs from the speaker binding posts if you want to use banana plugs, which I did. The volume controls feel a little tight, but you can feel the detents. I powered it up with no signal at the inputs and volume maxxed out to test for noise. This guy is QUIET!!! There is so much power stored in its reserve that after I turned it off (with no signal at the inputs) it took a good minute before the pilot light extinguished. Now, this amp is a behemoth. At 8 ohms load, it can produce 550 watts per channel, RMS! Have mercy on the speakers that get a taste of what this baby can do fully cranked! I have mine in my living room, and my ears hurt after listening at what I would consider 10th row back at a live rock concert. My custom FrankenSpeakers can easily handle 400 watts RMS and this amp really pushes them. I play hard rock like classic metal like Steppenwolf, Deep Purple, Zeppelin, etc and Oh Boy.

"I bought this system to find a way to amplify a country/bluegrass string band that has vocals, guitars, fiddle, banjo, and dobro. This was my first ever purchase of a PA system and I'm pleased with the results. I don't have a huge vehicle and don't like hauling a ton of heavy gear, so I wanted something pretty small and portable. This system is very compact, very lightweight (compared to other PA equipment I've used), well designed, and extremely easy to set up right out of the box. It looks and feels solid, and produces a really clear, pleasing sound. It may not have the punch and power for louder bands, and it may not be big enough to fill a big dance hall or theater with powerful sound. For what I've used it for - small cafes or bars, and for some smaller outdoor venues, it has worked great. I thought about going with those compact Bose tower units, but I just couldn't get my head around the cost.

Some limitations of this Yamaha system should be kept in mind. The advertising describes it has having 10 inputs. While that is literally true, channels on channels 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10 are stereo channels where two ""channels"" share the same level controls. For a band, that means that for most purposes channels 5-10 constitute at most three usable inputs rather than six. Plus, channels 9/10 only take RCA inputs (probably a feature intended for DJs or other uses involving AV equipment rather than musical performance). Pretty early on I realized that when I have our full 5-piece band, with three singers and five instruments, I just wasn't going to have enough inputs, especially mic inputs with built-in preamps (there are four of those on this mixer). So I had to go get a small, inexpensive Mackie mixer, and I do a vocal mix in the Mackie and then run an output from that into the Yamaha. Then run the rest of the inputs straight into the Yamaha.  So in retrospect this system may not have been the best choice for me, but I'm still really pleased with how it performs and admire its good design and quality.

Some other limitations to be aware of are that EQs controls are limited to two knobs per channel (high and low), which isn't a lot of control, but I haven't found this a big handicap, although perhaps as I gain more expertise in setting up for live sound, I'll start to want more control of that. Reverb is available on the first four channels. The reverb is just an on-off switch so while it sounds pretty good, you are not going to be able to really shape how the reverb sounds. Also note that if you are performing music with this system, it comes with great speakers but no monitors are included, so you'll probably also need to invest in one or more powered monitor speakers for the musicians. For my small band, one good powered monitor seems to be sufficient, although two might be better.",5.0

Works great with both, love the Shift option gives me a lot of flexibility (to a point that I cant remember what is what!), the jog wheels have pressure sensor too which is great, but unfortunately they are plastic just feels cheaper then the Numark Mixtrack Pro.

That being said I was debating if I should get the Mixtrack Pro but at the end I chose the Hercules mostly for the functionality on the pads and buttons - Mixtrack Pro is a bit more complicated and not as flexible (easy to map) as the Hercules...some people will be like, ""Hercules instead of Numark? wth"", well I did and I am happy with the purchase. I would love to have aluminum jog wheels but I prefer being able to use loops, cues, samples and other mapped options. As far as the ""air"" thing, its cool, looks cool, gets the jon done, same as the tape on the Numark. Sound card works good no issues, headroom for headphones is good, maybe not as Mixtrack 3 but powerful enough.

"I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the ""ball joint"" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.

This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.

The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.

The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably don't have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand.",5.0

These are beautiful. Self powered, 40W. Separate Bass/Treble and separate Left/Right volume controls.

They have about any type of input you need, 1/8 audio jack, RCA, Coax plus, my favorite, Digital.

The performance is fantastic, the quality and workmanship is very, very good.

The sound is a 'wake-up' call to anyone using regular PC speakers. This is High-Fi. I'm running them from an Alienware 18x, Win-8-Pro using an External SoundBlaster THX USB soundbox connecting them to the speakers via a digital cable.

They work great just from the PC's sound port, but I wanted the control and software with the SoundBlaster USB 3.0 box, plus making everything Digital from the PC to the Speakers.

"It's built sturdy, there's absolutely no line noise, and the effects are outstanding.

Beware, there is a learning curve.  It may take time to arrange and configure the pedals to find the sound you want (just like if you owned the actual pedals) but I'm convinced this little box can produce any tone I need.

It has a built in tuner, headphone jack, USB output (great for recording), and can be battery powered.  I'm a big fan of the Tech 21 Sansamp preamp.  The Sansamp model in the Zoom B3 sounds exactly like my Sansamp pedal.  While creating a patch using the Aphex Punch Factory model on the Zoom B3, I looked at the manual for the actual Punch Factory pedal on the Aphex web site.  Many of the models are THAT accurate.  I love this thing.",5.0

"When I have time available, I'm a looping artist that plays trippy/psychadelic/trip-hop music and is always attracted to delays, reverbs, and weird sounds. I was in the market for some sort of modulation effect for my pedalboard. I haven't messed around with modulation effects much, the few that I have tried sounded bad to me. This is definitely a nice assortment of weird mod sounds. I wrote something recently and had a guitar loop part that I wanted to make ""weird"", so I tried all 16 sounds with that guitar part while jamming in my garage lastnight. After about 1-2 hours of jamming, the auto wah settings might be my favorite so far for the stuff I do, which is surprising to me, but most of the effects seem like they can be usable in some way. You really have to mess with the three knobs for each effect on it's own, rather than just scroll through each effect type, if you want it to sound usable. The only reason I give this 4/5 and not 5/5 is because there is a tiiiiiiiiny bit of signal loss with the effect on on at least some of the effects, which you'd think would be a deal-breaker or make the rating even lower, but to be honest it's not horrible, it's not unusable, and for whatever it's being used for you can probably still get it to cut through a mix live or layers of loops by increasing the effect mix or intensity. Also, it seems well-built, I love the color and I love that it's a blue LED. The real test will be when I use this live I guess, so if my mind changes after that then I'll let you know haha. I hope this is helpful to anyone. Party on!",4.0

"The bugle arrived earlier than what was estimated in excellent condition.  My grandson
had a hard time getting up in the mornings so we had the idea to give

The bugle was the motivation he needed and he loves it!  He is only allowed to use it
for ""roll call"" so it will continue to motivate. In some of the reviews the mouthpiece
seemed to be a problem. . . but the mouthpiece doesn't bother him
at all.  Maybe it's because he doesn't use it as often as others in the reviews, but
at any rate our bugle is just what we wanted.  He had no trouble blowing it either!

"The US600 is a very versatile guitar effect for a pretty amazingly low price.  It actually duplicates most the effects of a harmonizer circuit I developed nearly 20 years ago, but never got around to packing into a box.  It's also a lot more reliable than that old breadboard ever was. ;)

For starters, it's an octave doubler, and can provide a second voice an octave below \or\ an octave above the note you're playing; you can also get two octaves below.  As an octave doubler alone, it would be worth the going price:  tracking is amazingly good throughout the range of the guitar, and the sound of the doubled note is richer and more ""guitar-like"" than the simple square wave of many octave boxes in this price range.

You can also track any other interval in the 12-tone scale, above or below your main note:  5th, 4th, 2nd, etc.  There is straight tracking (e.g., every note played is tracked at the same interval -- say a M3rd), and there is also a ""smart"" tracking feature, which lets you pick a key, and adjusts intervals to reflect diatonic pitches in that key.  For example, setting to US600 to the key of C, and the interval to a 3rd, playing C-D-E will produce M3, m3, m3, preserving the harmonic relationships of the key.  This can be very useful if you play a lot of conventionally tonal  music (which, frankly, is at least 90% of all pop, rock, folk, jazz, country, and classical music).  Those with a little music theory will understand what I'm talking about.

Controlled simulated whammy-bar effects are also possible:  bends up or down to a specific pitch; true vibrato (warbling variation in the pitch of every note, speed controllable); radical detunings such as ""dive bombs"", etc.

The five controls are (mostly) intuitive, quiet, and fluid throughout their range.  Interesting to me is that the ""Mode"" dial is not a multi-position rotary ""snap"" switch, but a continuous pot, which allows for some subtle blends of various effects between the specifically marked modes.

Dual outputs allow splitting the straight and harmony signals (with octave boxes I would often run the straight signal into a guitar amp and the octave into a bass amp).  There is also an input for an ""expression pedal"" --  a high impedance volume pedal, which I have not tried yet.
Footswitch activation is positive, quiet, and the box features true bypass -- there is no ""sucking"" away of your guitar signal by the dormant effect.

While not a defect, for the sake of completeness note that, except for the dive bombs, most effects only work as intended on single note lines.  Playing multiple notes produces some occasionally interesting random effects, however, so they're worth experimenting with. But, this sort of tracking is common in lower-priced harmony devices -- if you want to shift whole chords up or down a fifth, expect to pay several hundreds of dollars (at least) for the devices that do that, and maybe a hexaphonic pickup for your axe.

I should mention that this box worked well with both my electric (Gibson SG special) and acoustic (Taylor 214 with piezo pickup) instruments.

There were two minor caveats for me, hence four, rather than five stars:  As with most Behringer gear, the electronics are first-rate, but the physical packaging leaves something to be desired.  The housing of this box, and the pedal flap, are made of plastic.  Thick, high quality plastic, to be sure, but plastic all the same.  I cannot see this box standing up to a great deal of road travel; on the other hand, for $50, you can probably afford to carry a spare or two for when the first one breaks.

The second caveat concerns battery replacement.  The battery is under the switch flap, and you need some sort of a tool to poke the spring latches on each side of the hinge to remove the flap and replace the battery.  This results in at least two pieces coming loose and potentially getting lost or damaged at an inconvenient time:  the flap itself, and the return spring for the flap.  It is my personal philosophy that NO part should ever have to be completely detached from a box to replace a battery; it's just asking for trouble.

That aside, there aren't very many boxes that give you this much versatility for $50.  Some very nice sounds here.  Put it in a metal box, Behringer, and I'll give you another star!

"If you've used really cheap strings, or simply haven't replaced a decent pair in eons, you know there's a moment where your guitar either can't stay in tune at all or sounds like it's being played in an aluminum can: no brightness or low-end left whatsoever.

Not so with these guys. I love them. Yes, they're double the cost of some really decent strings, but they also last twice as long, and I've yet to snap them. Since I'm just an amateur player (no gigs) and enjoy acoustic guitar more anyway, I figured I'd buy one pair of these and keep them on until they broke or just stopped sounding decent. I play for two or more hours ever day. It's been at least six months, and they're just now starting to wear down. Amazing.

I will say that when you first get these, the coating feels bizarre. Very slick, almost like nylon. Nothing you can't get used to, though, and it fades with time.",5.0

"Fender Mustang 1 Amplifier Review

I bought this amplifier at Guitar Center for $75 during their Father's Day Sale, list price is $149.99, and have been playing with it every day for about six months. It's an impressive little practice amp that crams a lot of effects and `amp models' into a solid, well built and organized package with a simple user interface. It also shipped with the Ableton Recording software and also Amplitude, which allows you to create, tweak and download amp models on a PC or Mac and install them on the amplifier.

At 20 watts, this is good sized practice amp. It's more than enough to irritate our condo neighbors, and so most of the time I use a pair of Senheiser HD201S headphones ($25). Because the Mustang 1's primary feature is the multiple onboard amp models, it wouldn't be fair to say that the Mustang 1 doesn't have a distinctive sound, like a `57 Deluxe does, or `59 Bassman, or `65 Twin Reverb; but this amp does a good job recreating each of those distinctive sounds, and several others. Have I played through all those amps and done a side-by-side analysis? No, but as a hobbyist with a pretty minimal guitar -- I play a 2002 Squire Silver Sparkle Jagmaster -- I really appreciate the many varieties of sounds it creates and fact that I don't yet have to spend a ton of dough on effects pedals. The American `90s setting, which is apparently intended to sound like a Mesa Boogie, is a big favorite, and it's got a clearly different sound than the Metal 2000, Super-Sonic and other distortion settings.

The interface has the standard Gain, Volume, Treble, Bass and Master controls -- a mid would have been nice -- as well as the selector dial for Presets (`57 Deluxe, `59 Bassman, `65 Twin Reverb, British `60s, Metal `80s, American `90s, Super Sonic and Metal 2000). It also has ""Mod"" and ""Delay/Reverb"" dials that give you an onboard chorus, flanging, phasing, tremolo, vibratone, step filter, reverb, echo, octaver, 12 modulation effects and 12 delay and reverb effects. You can spend a lot of time tweaking these, and despite using this amp for an hour or more a day, I feel like I'm just getting started.

It took some getting used to, but each Preset has three settings: standard, and two variants, that you can create using the dashboard, or software, and save. An LED indicates which is operative. There are a lot of possibilities here, and even more for someone motivated enough to download additional models. Honestly, I haven't done much with the software beyond installing it yet, as you need a guitar/computer interface or a preamp. So far, I have been content to plug in a pair of headphones and go. It does have a USB connection and more importantly, at least for now, it has an auxiliary in so that you can plug in an iPod. It's smart.

There's a lot to like about this amp. It seems well crafted, with a fully enclosed case and a recessed dashboard to minimize the chance of ripping the knobs off when you tip it or drop it. And it looks like a Fender amp, with the silver grill and logos. The marketing phrase is ""High Speed, Amped up and Loud,"" and this thing delivers.

"Worked with my Roland R_05 recorder. I got some clean audio for a friend's audition tape. I'm not sure what it is, perhaps the mic or the recorder, but I felt that the levels weren't very high when recording to my digital recorder. I had to bring up audio levels a bit in post production.

Not a bad mic but definetly NOT one I would use if I were working on a professional gig. Good for sit down interviews where the mic can be placed and the interviewee is not moving around a lot. This model comes a long cable, a very long cable. You'll need to find a way to keep it on a spool and protected since the wires are thin.

Good tool for the amateur journalist and videographer. Nice to get the hands on experience of working with lavs, and if it breaks; it is not terribly expensive to get another one.",4.0

"Recently bought this case for two reasons: 1) was interested in the nylon-type hardshell cases and 2) the price. As it turns out this guitar case was an excellent choice! I priced numerous brands of others and buying straight from a retailer would have cost me minimum $10.00 more. This case was the best price (with shipping added!) than the area competitors.
The Laurel houses safely both my Fender Strat or my Ibanez GRG models. There are three zippered pockets to hold picks and strings, cords, music books and a pedal or two. It has a zipper to keep the case closed and a backpack-like strap to carry the case. There are no inner pockets but the outside has enough to hold your gear. The handle is a wrap around, velcro-sealed type.
Two minor flaws: 1) there is maybe a 1/2 inch play that the guitar can move while housed. Nothing that would damage the guitar but may turn the tuner pins in transport. 2) The zippers are somewhat fragile so I wouldn't want to yank hard when zipping.
Other than that this nylon, hardshell guitar case gets an A+ in my book. Great deal for the price and a versitile piece of equipment.",5.0

"love these strings, but they require some modifications to some acoustic bass guitars...
They sound great and are easy to play, but the blue thread winding at the ball at the end of the string is too bulky to fit thru the holes in the bridge of my Fender BG-29. When I first put the strings thru the end of the string stuck out about an inch from the bridge. It looked stupid and I was worried about it splitting the bridge. So I bought a small round file for a few bucks and slowly bored the hole out a little. Both the E and A string holes required a little boring so the winding at the ball end would fit snugly in. The blue thread winding of the E string goes to the nut, it touches it, I wish it were a little shorter and I guess thinner so others wouldn't run into the same problem I did and have to bore their guitar bridge holes like I did. It was worth the modifications to me as I plan to continue putting these strings on it. One other modification it required was adjusting the neck so as to lower the action some. These strings, I think from what I've read, have more tension and will bow the neck of some guitars. Mine did bow and the action got higher and the intonation sucked, so I got an allen key and slowly slowly turned the rod so as to counter act the bow. I turned it slightly clockwise to straighten it out....  these are all things I should have had someone (professional) do but it was sunday and I wanted to play and not search for a repair guy who'd answer his phone on a sunday... so I adjusted the truss rod myself against my better judgement. It worked out fine, the action is much lower and it plays great and is in tune with itself....",4.0

"Please realize that this component cooling fan is only about 3""x3"" across. Because of it's small size, I do not feel that the heat being exhausted by the fan is being pushed out well enough/powerfully enough.

This fan is so tiny compared to the size of the vent of my A/V receiver (and I assume this will be the case for most receivers), that I did not feel the tiny guy could do the job well if I just placed it anywhere on the vents.  So I had to feel for the hottest spot on the vents and then place this product right on top of the worst heat source just so I could feel this tiny fan could do better work that way.

Then there's the ""power"" issue. The worst heat source happens to be in the back, right corner of my receiver, so I have the fan sitting on top of that area and I directed the exhaust towards the front of the receiver. The problem with that is that the fan does not propel the exhaust away from the heat source powerfully enough, so basically, I feel the hot air being pulled from within the vent is just being pushed to the top of the receiver and maybe 3-5 inches away from the hotspot. Unfortunately, that means the heat is still sitting on top of another portion of the same vent! That's what I mean by tiny and weak.

If the motor was more powerful/fan was faster it would be able to more efficiently exhaust the heat AWAY from the receiver (I mean that IS the point, right?). I would love if the the product was so powrful that you could feel the heat being extracted from the vents and being pushed out somewhere towards the front of the receiver (as opposed to feeling that ""aura"" of heat collecting in the back of the entertainment center); unfortunately, this lil fan does not have the power to do that.

I've actually bought USB fans (with plastic, flexible ""blades""!!) that push air far better than this product (in fact I bought that fan from amazon and left a review for it as well here).

If I had anything good to say about this product it would be that it operates very quietly and turns on automatically when the component gets hot. So you can leave it plugged in and never have to worry about turning it on/off as a separate component.

I've had this for a couple of months now and sometimes I wonder if it's helping at all. That's not piece of mind for $60. The plugs are made to be daisy-chained together so I guess you can buy 2 or 3 of these to place over the vents and then MAYBE that'll be enough to cover the venting area sufficiently. Maybe that multiple to $120 or $180 will be piece of mind for someone else but for me... I'm still looking for a better solution because I would NOT buy anymore of these.",1.0

"I've had the Intelli IMT-900 for several months.  Being my first chromatic tuner it was cool at first and I put up with the fact that low E is so difficult to read.  But this is a tool and over time it got to be too much of a pain in the rear.  Sometimes it just won't read it (low E), sometimes it will pick it up if you go to the 12th fret... or if you reposition the unit 3 or 4 times... or it will read it for a second (literally) and then drop off.... sometimes it will read it but tell you it's an 'A'.... sometimes it just refuses.  And 'A' is difficult at times.  This occurs on all 3 of my acoustic guitars.  If I had not kept it too long I would return it. I debated between 2 and 3 stars - the unit is bright, easy to use (except as noted above), has good mechanical adjustments, seems to be well made, and will transpose (flat/sharp) - but it has shortcomings in performing it's primary function.",3.0

I would totally recommend the product, though it should be used carefully every time because you have to adjust several parts before it is totally safe to let go, plus a lot of parts are made of plastic, so it's not a good idea to over tighten them or put a lot of pressure when trying to disassemble.",4.0

While looking at the various options for boatswain whistles I found that there was really two options.  The copper one in a pretty box or this one for more than double the price.  Looking at the reviews I found the copper one had a lot of five star reviews saying it was a great display piece.  The reviews talking about whether it worked or not were varied.  Sometimes it did sometimes it didn't.  The five star reviews for this one were more about how well it works.  Needing one that works I went with the Acme whistle and I don't regret it.  It whistles well and is very loud.  If you want a display piece settle for the one in the wooden box.  If you want something that works buy this one.,5.0

"I bought the MR5s and the JBL LSR305 together to test both of them.
Build Quality: These speakers are build like a tank, the moment you pick them up you can tell its a quality product.
Size: If you plan on using them as desktop monitors, they are quite wide and deep, so make sure you have enough space.

Pros: They sound quite phenomenal, the built in amplifiers drive them beautifully with minimal distortion across the frequency response. At 50% volume they are plenty loud to a small room for personal listening. They have a weak low end, which is okay for monitors this size. But don't get me wrong, they bass response is not too shabby, its very smooth and tight with minimal boomy resonance. The highs are also crystal clear and depending on the quality of the source, create a nice image of the sound.

Cons (compared to the LSR305s): The main problem that I felt while listening to these and the JBLs was that for some reason, I felt the MKs gave me a headache after extended hours of listening. I would feel fatigued after listening to the MKs at medium volumes. I feel this has go to do with the tweeters used in these speakers, they give me a feeling of listening to a PA (outdoor) style tweeter, which is usually harsh to listen to at close proximity. This was the biggest problem with these speakers, I could live with the subtle low end response, but I could live with harsh sounding monitors that would give me a headache after a couple of hours. Another slight problem was, again this might be purely subjective, but the HF and LF trimmers on the MKs don't really make too much of a difference in the sound, I mean they do, but its barely noticeable. I understand that its a 2dB +/-, but on the JBLs its the same value of trimming yet its quite noticeable.

The JBLs on the other hand are extremely bright compared to the MKs, yet they never felt harsh or fatiguing even after hours of listening. The JBLs also have a nice low end response. The JBLs are also smaller, less heavy, have better amplification and the sound quality is just terrific.
My advice is to audition both of these speakers before you make a decision since both of them cost similar to each other.
My pick out of the two would be the JBL LSR305s.",3.0

"I bought this recorder a month ago and I enjoy it very much! I have played a German-fingered Hohner wooden soprano (the cheap one) for over a year, and of course I like the sound of a wooden recorder better, but I had two problems with it: first, I could never really play C# and D# well enough because it doesn't have double-holes. I know that baroque sopranos do, but the holes may be too small for my fingers to close one hole easily. Anyway, I don't have this problem with Aulos A211A, I could take C# and D# almost from the first day of playing, which means I can play along with almost any melody! Also, remember that other tenor recorders have a C/C# key, which means (as I understand) that you won't be able to play both C and C# in one melody. With this one, you can play anything you like.
Secondly, the wooden recorder (I have two-pieced one) falls apart if you don't play for two days because wood gets dryer. I call it 'recorder jealousy', maybe you don't have this with more expensive wooden recorders? If someone could tell me, I would be grateful. Anyway, the Aulos is always ready to play - it's plastic so it doesn't matter if you don't play for weeks.
I always wanted to have a lower recorder, and tenor's just good for me. You don't have to learn much new fingering after having played a soprano recorder because it's in C too. After having played piano for a couple of years it wasn't so hard for me to reach the holes with the fingers, the only problem being the G (a bit hard for the fourth finger of the left hand to reach that hole fast).
As you all know, the only problem is that it doesn't hold water at all, as all plastic recorders don't. But I'm very glad I bought this recorder at a great price and I really enjoy it! A pretty case it comes in is worth mentioning too, of course.",5.0

"These come as a pair, which makes them about half the price of competing products. Sound response seems pretty flat, which is good. They don't have much response in the sub-bass realm, but that's to be expected in 4-5"" speakers.

The quality is decent. I wouldn't use these in a professional studio, but for the average home studio that lacks the sound isolation of a real control room, they're adequate. Since a step up is a significant price difference, I would recommend these as a low-cost entry into studio monitors; if the choice is between this and headphones/home stereo equipment, then you should make the investment.",4.0

"I own the following Virtual drummer plug-ins: BFD, Steven Slate Drums, idrum, Strike and RMX. None of these hold a candle to EZDrummer and EZDrummer is the entry level product! I quickly upgraded to their flagship Superior Drums withing 2 months because it worked and sounded so great. I use it on both the Logic Studio and Pro Tools platforms and it works flawlessly.

What does EZDrummer have that's so much better then the others? First off all a beat library that has a naming nomenclature that makes logical sense. Nothing else does that I've tried or seen. Go find a funk beat in BFD, the name with imply how funkifized it is but it won't tell you a thing about what instruments are used or where they land in the beat structure. Real Genius those guys at FX, plus their support is staffed by children who are as untrained as they are rude.

Second, it's bug free and rock solid. It's like the energizer bunny of Virtual Drummers, it runs and runs and runs without an over bloated sample library weighing down the computer. Try to get Steven Slate drums to give you multiple out's in Logic. Their tech support will blame it on Native instrument and the kontact player it's samples run on so you call them, then they say no it's Steven Slates issue. You can even send them a video of your screen and whats happening with out as so much as a return email once they can't figure out how to fix it. After 4 weeks you realize you have hundreds of dollars worth of software that doesn't work and the vendor could care less.

RMX is even worse, they don't have a tech support forum and they never answer email period. All you can do is call and hope they pick up. I can't recommend any of these 3 products and I payed for all of them.

EZDrummer is so rock solid, so bug free and simple to use I can now deliver finished product to my clients instead of to a drummer to bring in so he can have a rough idea of what he needs to play @ $100 an hour. In less then a few hours I can have full drum track arrangements in multiple time signatures that sound incredible and human. The genius in the naming conventions make altering a beat easy and user friendly. Even the stock drum kit that comes with it can sound really nice if you're handy with a compressor and EQ. The one time I contacted tech support my answer came via email in less then 24 hours and their support board is staffed by employees as well as power users. I have used it little because the software runs so intuitively.

For all the people complying about getting the software to authorize get used to it. Being an audio engineer means just that, an engineer. It's not flogging photo shop. You have to learn the ropes of information systems enough to learn how to use a challenge and response system to activate software. Out of all the software companies I deal with ToonTrack has the best and easiest to use authorization system. If you think you have it bad with EZ go try a piece spectrasonics or Celemony software, you may wait weeks to get them to even notice your alive let alone authorize the software that you've already paid for.",5.0

They are easy for him to grab with one hand, but they don't fit inside his mouth (which would pose a choking hazard). They also have helped him to experiment and learn about the world around him. He'll take an egg in one hand and another small object in the other. Then he'll shake each one in turn and notice how one makes a sound and the other doesn't.",5.0

"This pedal is amazing. It is marvelous and easy to use out of the box but when you have the skills to use the Beat buddy manager software it really shines.
I have been creating custom rhythms and songs on a DAW and then import them onto the manager and assigning different drums and the results are astonishing. Irregular rhythms 7/8, 9/8 , 11/8 sound gorgeous.  You can change the drum sets on the pedal and get complete acoustic sets with percussion when playing acoustic sets, or get full drum set when playing Rock music. The possibilities are endless.
I have also been using it with a looper Quantiloop and its syncs perfect. The sync works both ways. Amazing.
There is dedicated forum with dudes who are so quick in response and advice it feels like you have the whole community holding you back.
And the Customer support is second to none.
I have a lot of gear and over the years have had contacts with many companies but the response and treatment you get from Singular Sound and especially Jay is  the best I have ever experienced.
This is an example of a dedicated team who put their customers first.

It plays well, sounds good, is easy to tune and stays in tune, and the accessories are all decent quality and work well.  I cannot say that this would be the instrument of choice for an older, more accomplished player but for a beginner, it costs less than six months' rental of a more typical student instrument, and for that you get your own, brand new instrument that in many cases will sound better than a rental that's been abused for years.",5.0

"I have been using these with several of my vintage Roland VG synths and they've held up well over the years. I don't make the mistake of leaving the power supply plugged in all the time as these are basically on all the time even though the GR unit may be switched off. Don't believe me? Leave your's plugged in and come back in an hour ... it will be warm to the touch.
My two complaints are:
1. AC cord on one side and output cable on the other makes for a bulky cable mess. Too bad Visual Sound does not make a One Spot version of this power adapter since they only use one cable on their One Spot units. Less muss and fuss and less one cable likely to short out.
2. The output cable is flimsy and I do have one power supply I have to make sure to store carefully as to not pinch the cable at the bulky power supply end.

"This is the perfect option for those who don't want to spend a fortune on equipment and software.  You get the GuitarPort hardware along with software that will give you a ton of unique sounds.  If I would've known about this when I bought my first guitar I wouldn't have picked up an amp (it's just been collecting dust while I use my GuitarPort).  The sound is superb.  It's very rich and sounds like it was recorded in a studio.

Set up of the GuitarPort was very simple and I was playing in about 5 minutes!

One important thing to note is that you cannot record with the software provided with the GuitarPort.  But not to worry!  Once you have the GuitarPort software installed you can go to the Line 6 website and download their RiffTracker software to record all the music you can make.  One nice thing about the RiffTracker is the InstantDrummer feature which allows you to set the tempo and variation for different types of drums and match it with your style of play on the guitar.  And the drums sound great!

GuitarPort($99) + RiffTracker Recording software($99) = Equals the perfect way to record your own music on the cheap!",5.0

"I am a guitar player who occasionally fills in on bass at our church. I had been borrowing a standard 34"" bass but I wanted to try something a little smaller. I purchased an Ibanez Mikro to fill this need. What can I say, this is a great short-scale bass! I cannot believe the quality you can get for under $200. I had to slightly adjust the action and the intonation, but otherwise this thing was great right out of the box. The smaller scale makes it so much easier for a guitarist like me to play, and the pickups are actually pretty decent, too. The body is comfortable and lightweight.

I am very impressed with this bass and I am very happy with my purchase.",5.0

"It seems many issues with this tool may be related to user error, or other problems with the guitar or setup.  The action on my electric is ludicrously low, and it works just fine with this cleaner.  You have to use just a wee bit of force to get it up near the nut, but this doesn't make your strings last for an eternity, it's just good practice to keep them feeling, looking, and sounding their best as long as possible.  If guitar strings can take extreme Floyd-Rose abuse, they can take a little tugging after long sessions to clean dirt and grime.

Despite that the manufacturer claims no solutions are necessary, you can certainly apply them to the cloth.  I won't make recommendations as to which to use, as it seems to be a touchy subject... but if you do wipe your strings with any cleaning solution, you can apply it to this cloth, and if you have two, use another to remove the excess.",5.0

"I have an old guitar recently stopped working. After further inspection I discovered that one of my coils stopped working. I figured, ""What the hell? I'll look on Amazon."". I found this little guy right away. After I ordered it I received it within a few days. It was taller than the pickup I removed but extra space in the guitar body took care of that problem.

"This is an interesting new design from Gator with different models available for acoustic and electric guitars. I bought the electric model, Gator G-PG Electric Pro Go Series Gig Bag.

The design elements, materials and construction are high quality. The tough outer fabric of the case has one large cargo pocket with an integrated iPad compartment, sewn-in Velcro cable loops, and various interior pouches for a few pedals or other items, plus room for a good sized binder holding your sheet music in the main compartment. There are also several smaller pockets in different places around the exterior of the bag, each secured by a good zipper.

There were a couple of design points that interested me when I first learned about this gig bag: the full weather cover that stows in its own pocket, and the removable backpack straps that can be attached to different points to allow for a more flexible fit.

Now that I've used the bag several times to transport my instrument, I can see that these features are designed and built well. The zippers are all quality. The backpack straps feel like they will stand up well to regular use without the padding breaking down. Since I use the backpack straps almost every time I use the case, I need them to last.

The foam that provides impact protection for your instrument is fairly dense. It is thick enough to stand up to the bumps and scuffs that any gig bag is subjected to in the world of rehearsing and performing musicians. This bag isn't marketed as something to transport your guitar as checked airline baggage, and you would want something more solid for that job.

As effective as this gig bag is for most of my needs, I would have more confidence in it if it were made with high density rigid foam instead of the soft foam they chose. I use a rigid foam gig bag (Wolfpack) to transport my acoustic, and the rigid foam makes me more confident about more serious mishaps, such as slipping on the ice while carrying my instrument, or some drunk fan in a crowded bar stepping on it because he was too out of it to see that a gig bag had fallen over.

A couple other improvements I'd suggest would be:
- a little more gusseting on the main pocket to allow for carrying more cargo without having to stress the zipper.
- the addition of reflective piping or panels to make this black bag more visible at night when I'm crossing the street with it.

I think the price is a little high, but the features it has are very good. Overall, I give it a solid 4 stars. With some additional main pocket capacity, rigid foam, and some reflective surfaces, it would be an easy five star rating to make.",4.0
"This pedal has a great sound for a great deal. If you adjust the tone settings on treble you can get high pitched wailing sounds and, with it on bass you can get fuzzy deep blusey sounds (so deep it rattled my ten watts sound plate) . The body is much more chunky then the picture implies and is sturdy enough to last a pretty long time . The pedal also has true bypass ( a clean pedal-guitar-amplifier connection) and is supposed to replicate a tube amp (most professionals use tub amps only) sound, which it does pretty well. This is my first pedal but I have tried a few and this works pretty great. Overall this is a great addition to any pedal chain. The only reason that it is rated four stars is because the switch is a little hard to operate (which can be a good thing).",5.0

Expression and volume pedals are one of those necessities that can really add a lot to your guitar and or keyboard rig, however many of them just seem junky or low quality, or if they are more sturdy they are very expensive.

I only have room for one expression pedal on my board and by getting this pedal I am able to do all I want to do depending on the situation.  I can hook it up as a volume pedal or hook it up as an expression pedal and control whammy type effects, wah wah, or any other pedal that takes an expression input.  The sound as a volume pedal is great and one other plus is that it does not need any sort of power.  Get it for all your volume/expression needs.",5.0

"Like most DJs I have used many different headphones.
I have 2 broken pair of the HDJ-1000s in a box and was meaning to get them repaired as both sets broke at the hinge area.
After reading the reviews I knew I had to try the new version, the HDJ-2000s, and they did not disappoint.
Love at first listen...
They sound better than any other pair I have owned, and it is a lot easier to tell when a track has been hyper-compressed, if the mids have a little too much highs, etc...
The clarity and separation was very nice for ""DJ"" headphones.
These babies can be used for DJing and production and claim a spectral range of 5Hz - 30KHz.
I have been using them for my iPhone, while driving, while taking skype calls, and while listening to iTunes through audio interface on laptop. Basically everywhere.
Time will tell about breaking at the hinge area, but they look very well engineered and they feel solid.

"I bought this from EBay in January 2004, and from what I see today Amazon is offering an excellent price.
On first appearance, this software looks to be complciated to learn.  The thing is, they packed it with more features than I personally would ever need.  If you have the patience, you can really get some neat things out of the software.  I played around with it, but eventually discarded the manual and started using it just like my old tape-drive 4-track recorder.  Build-in metronome?  Cool.  Don't need it.  Built-in effects?  Might use it someday.  Not today.  So - you can get off the ground with the basic pretty quickly.  One really neat thing is graphicly selecting regions that you want to punch in before hitting record.  All in all, really good.
There are a couple of clunky thing about it that you can work around easily - if you try to record a track before selecting an input device, for example, that track isn't going to work again (so just deleted it and make a new one).  Double-clicking a Cakewalk file from file explorer results in an error, so bring up the application first, then load the file.  I haven't run into any really drastic bugs, but makes me wonder when I will.
Okay - my big beef - you have to pay extra to enable mixing down to MP3.  I personally find it very obnoxious to buy a fully-featured, production piece of software - and then they want MORE MONEY - $30 - to enable what should be a standard feature.  You can mix down to plenty of formats, sure, but let's face it, you'd expect MP3 to be a pretty standard format to use.  I feel cheated and not respected as a customer of the product when the developers resort to this kind of money-grubbing.
Well, I was going to give 2 starts because of the MP3 thing, but to be fair, overall this is a really nice piece of software, so it deserves a balanced review.  Happy recording!",4.0

"I am fan of Razer, I have multiple keyboards, mice, and headsets from Razer and I enjoy them all. I was excited to see the Seiren announcement, and ordered the bundle from Razer.

Pros: Looks sexy as hell. The included stand is heavy and holds the mic well. The on-mic controls are handy and provide quick switching between gain level, headphone monitor levels, and mic modes. USB audio means no sound interference you normally experience with a sound card, and the fact that the Seiren also doubles as a soundcard is nice for using the headphone monitor jack for computer audio as well.

Cons: There's no warning given about the gain level. A lot of reviews complain about the clipping and the poor audio quality. This is because the gain needs to be turned all the way down (in my experience). If the gain is not set at 0, then you will experience clipping and overall bad sound quality. It's also important to disable ""Allow applications to control this device"" in your Windows recording device settings, because some applications will automatically adjust the volume and make the mic unusable. This is not a con with the mic, but a con in the documentation that is mostly non-existent from Razer for an entry-level mic like this.

Overall, this is a great mic, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something that not only sounds good, but looks good. I am only recording voice for a podcast with this mic, so I can not vouch for the quality outside of the cardioid mode. I will update this review when I get the Audio-Technica AT2020USB to compare the two.",4.0

"I originally purchased the Remo Skyndeep Conga head for my Quinto but I did not like the high pitched overtones. Even though it was my first foray into synthetic heads, I decided to give this one a shot. I'm glad I did!

Firstly, It was snug getting it onto the rim of my Comfort Curve II LP Classic, so before buying I highly recommend checking on Remo's website to confirm that the head will fit with your drum.

The tuning was easy and quick, the heads seem to naturally rest right in tune without any drop in tuning! Which is amazing!

Onto the most important part, the sound.. I love the sound of these heads!!! Its warm, full bodied, projects well and has a very very close sound to natural heads. Furthermore, they feel soft on your hands, not rough like the cow hide skins I had on previously. This means, you can play longer and more comfortably!

In addition, it was shipped fast and packaged well. I liked it so much I bought the 11.75"" head for my Conga as well!",5.0

"20FALLSAV at checkout and save 20% (I think it works until November 13th).

Great guitar and a great deal, too.  I don't have any experience with electric guitar, so I can't say much about the quality of the pickups or the amp, but I have played a few other stringed instruments and I am pleased with everything- from the delivery to the look and playability.

 I ordered with regular Prime shipping but it arrived the very next day- a huge box containing another box, with the amp and the guitar in an unpadded case on its side. There seemed to be a lot of space where it could have shifted about and been damaged, the only other packaging in there was a folded piece of cardboard, but it was in perfect shape.  The other items are stashed inside the pocket of the guitar case and very basic items- tuner strap, picks, cable, etc- the only thing that was missing was the chord chart, which is not really a problem for me.  The tuner is fine and does come with batteries, it tunes the same as another tuner I already have.

The guitar is very solidly built, hefty, and the finish on mine was good overall- the fretboard is smooth enough and none of the frets are rough or sharp.  The action (string height) is very low and it was barely out of tune.  It seems like someone may have gone over it before it was shipped, which is a big plus.  The tuners are nice and smooth and it has stayed tuned pretty well over the last few days of playing.  The only rough parts on mine is that the paint around the truss rod hole is a little sloppy, and the plastic around the pickup selector is a little rough.  I might sand them down when I change the strings if it bothers me, but these are minor issues for me, I think it looks and feels great overall. (ETA:  I just need to remove the plastic film on the pickguard, that was what felt rough)

I looked up a few chords and I was playing right away- sounds nice and clean, no buzzing and sounds even better plugged in.  I don't know much about the electronics, but the tone/volume selectors on the guitar did change the tone/volume coming off the various pickups, the amp also amplified and the overdrive sounds pretty cool, too.

The DVD is probably the worst part about this package- it is a waste of time, really.  The intro is a guy explaining general maintenance and how to change the strings.  That would be useful, but they don't show a close-up, so you can't see what he is doing.  There are two ""lessons"" with another guy that are mostly about reading standard music notation, including a pop quiz, and then plucking out individual notes on the B and e strings.  If you are going to spend time/money making a visual learning aid, why waste most of it talking about standard music notation?  He talks briefly about reading tabs, which most beginners are going to use, but doesn't even show any fingering. All bizarre choices in this DVD- skip it and seek out better tutorials online or anywhere else, really.

Samick also has a limited lifetime warranty on this guitar which I will post a link to in the comments-",5.0

"Phenomenal.  I have 11 basic Boss pedals, and as a ""newbie"" I was concerned this couldn't power all 11 due to all the different settings and output labels.  I went through an education.  First, no such thing as too much power.  More power is better than not enough, and you can't hurt your pedals that only need  100ma with a 500ma output from the CS12.  In addition, Trutone sells an adapter that you can use for the two  18v 100ma outputs to convert them to 9v.  This made it possible for me to power 11 basic pedals without hurting anything.  My previous pedals were daisy-chained together, and I can't tell you how much better they sound with the CS12.  All the noise is gone, and the pedals seem to have more ""range.""  In addition, they supply the perfect cables with perfect length.  When I was done wiring 11 pedals, I didn't even need a zip tie underneath my pedal board.  It's like  they know exactly how long that cable needs to be to reach that far.  Great support from Trutone.  They answered my questions via email very promptly and gave me the necessary education  that led me to make the purchase.  Can't say enough good things!",5.0

"I've had the Tascam DR-1 digital recorder since they were first released.  The only thing I didn't like about it was how to position it in relation to my band to get the best live recordings possible.  With the AK-DR1 Accessory Kit I'm able to position the recorder ""just so"" by bending the flexible legs any way I need to.  Also, if there's no table top available to place it upon, the other pieces in the kit allow mounting to a standard mic stand so the VU meters can be seen from a good distance in spite of their small size, so levels can be easily monitored while performing.  The only down side is that at $35+, it's roughly twice the price of the mic stand that's holding it.  All in all, though, it's still very much worth the price.",4.0
"I needed a portable recorder for conducting interviews at conventions (for example, San Diego Comic Con), so let me first say that I can't speak for this item's ability to record music. However, here are my thoughts:

PRICE: You get what you pay for. This isn't a very high-end recorder, but TASCAM is a good brand. I'm not sure I'd pay $150 for this particular recorder, but if the price drops a bit (perhaps more in the $100-120 range), the DR-22WL will be worth it.

CONSTRUCTION: It's fairly compact, about the size of an old Nokia cell phone, and LIGHT. Which is nice, except for the fact that it's almost TOO light and feels cheaply constructed. I have my doubts about how long it will last, and will update this review accordingly if need be.

RECORDING: The TASCAM DR-22WL is no frills and easy to use. It does have that ""extra"" dubbing function, which is nice, especially for a recorder in this price range. So far its recording quality has been good, though I've used it mostly in closer quarters and again only for interviews, not music.

WI-FI: Works okay but as another reviewer noted, it would have been way better for them to go with bluetooth (though again that would likely have made this recorder more expensive).

Overall, my review title says it all - though I think this recorder is a BIT overpriced, it's not glaringly so, and it's a good one for beginners.",4.0

"For an electric kit, this has that precise trigger and bounce back you would get from an acoustic snare. I like the fact you can tighten it up to get the exact feel you want. It's built solid, and looks pretty professional. I am currently using it with an alesis nitro kit, but this would work with any electric kit. Good side benefit it comes with its own mounts so you can reuse your original snare mount and then take your old snare and turn it into a tom 4 using the new mounts provided. **note**  the nitro kits frame is a smaller dia. So in order to use these new clamps you need to roll some black electric tape around your frame to make it a thicker diameter. Then mount works like a gem.",5.0

"I guess I will go five stars for this, but if there was a 4.5 I would do that.  We use these at a church that seats 200 with 2 to 5 spanish parishioners.  The range is super incredible, and with a brick church we would know if the range was anything other than good.  Quite frankly, I think you could use these 2 blocks away with no issues....

The sound for the receiver is great and the transmitter is literally plug and play.  I don't know what else to say, it's just a good system.

Now, the receivers seem cheap but after 6 mouths, not one has broken or stopped working.  What has broken and is cheap are the headphones.  We have 5 of 6 working now. However, the parishioners mainly bring their own and use them anyways, and since any headphone can plug in to the receiver this makes the system pretty versatile.  You can also split the outputs and double the audience size of you want.

"I purchased the Singtrix Party Bundle Premium Edition Home Karaoke System for our family Christmas 2017, and it was the hit of the holidays for our family and friends. Seriously, it was the most used and enjoyed gift during our holidays.
I purchased the matched set of Singtrix components in the Party Bundle, plus an extra Singtrix microphone for duets. I have plenty of music gear on hand at home, and could have purchased just the main unit and then added my own microphones, monitor, speakers, and mic stand. Glad I didn't do that. The Singtrix components were designed to work together, to have great sound, a simple setup, and easy portability. I have over 30 years experience as a part-time professional musician, and use professional level gear for performance and recording. Previously we had a popular brand CD-G portable karaoke machine for our family, but it was rarely used due to the poor quality. It made good singers sound bad, and poor singers want to quit. I donated that unit to the local thrift store, and purchased the Singtrix for our family. The Singtrix is a huge improvement over our previous karaoke setup. It has pro quality sound, and is designed to be as easy to operate as possible, considering the level of technology. It's obvious they put a lot of thought into the design. It will make you sound as good as you really are, and will help encourage developing singers to keep practicing by allowing them to sound as good as possible. The Singtrix is not a miracle working machine. You have to be able to sing the correct pitches of the melody as close as possible, in the key of the background music. If you are way out of pitch with the background music, it won't be able to help you. One singer in our family has trouble finding the starting pitch of the melody and sometimes starts in on a harmony note and then tries to sing the melody. The Singtrix can help pitch correct those notes, but it will not sound right.
Since we had been using a karaoke machine with CD-G discs for backing tracks, my plan was to convert all those songs to MP4 video files, load them into an iPad Mini or Windows10 tablet, and then que them up using a karaoke software program. We have hundreds of those CD-G karaoke songs and I didn't want to waste them.  Honestly, doing this conversion is a painstaking process and a whole lot of work. I have quite a few converted, but for expediency during the holidays, we just looked up karaoke songs on YouTube, and streamed them through our wireless home network. It works great and there are plenty of songs available. Currently we are using an iPad Mini plugged into the Singtrix via the 3.5mm stereo audio cable. The iPad holder is mounted up on the mic stand near the microphone, so reading the lyrics as they scroll is easy to do while you are singing. The only issue I've had is the plastic bracket/clamp that holds the main unit to the mic stand cracked/broke and the main unit fell to the floor. There was no damage, and Singtrix is replacing broken piece. A last bit of advice: Read the instructions thoroughly and refer to them often. If you need to remove the main unit from it's mic stand bracket, push in the plastic button at the rear-middle of the main unit to release it. Attempting to do this without pushing the release button will cause something to break.",5.0

"I don't know quite how to write this review.  It really depends on how sensitive you are about audiophile quality.  I, unfortunately, am completely sensitive and obsessed with flat and true sound; accuracy, to a fault..  I want to hear music, not speaker deficiencies.

These are VERY good for the money.  I would imagine that most people won't hear the deficiencies.  I am pretty much OCD about this type of thing.  It took me three years and $4,000 to build a flat system in my car (old school Eclipse, Boston Acoustics C6 with 400 Watts of MB Quart driving the fronts alone, JL in the rear, dual 12"" etc etc.blah blah (over 1000W RMS with very VERY low impedance)  I am obsessed with accurate audio.  I repeat, I don't want to hear speakers, I want to hear correct imaging with a flat EQ (no deficiencies in how the sound is represented.)

All of that being said, I purchased the ATH-M40x for my headphone computer and portable needs, primarily based on specs and reviews of comfort compared to the ATH-M50x (I want the detachable cables and I wear glasses.)  I really think I would prefer the extra 5mm on the driver of the 50x.  I am trying to replace my Sennheiser 380HD Pro's that got stolen.  There simply is no comparison on the accuracy and the smoothness and depth of the highs and lows of the Sennheisers (yes, I broke the 40's in properly.)  Absolutely no comparison.

If you value audiophile quality, the Sennheiser 380's are the way to go.  You give up cable options even though the Senns have a detachable cable like the AT 50x or 40x.

The Audio Technica ATH-M40x's are VERY comfortable and light, but seriously, go  Sennheiser 380's if you can handle a tighter fit on your head in exchange for phenomenally accurate sound.

Do you want ""good"" with really good comfort, or mostly comfortable with audiophile quality?  If the latter is your choice, go with the 380's. They  are outstanding.  If you don't have a freakishly sensitive ear, the ATH-M40X is a great buy. I may try the 50x, but the Sennheiser cans are proven outstanding to me already.  They are bliss.

As for the the 40x:
Pros:
Very comfortable and lightweight
Passable sound for most
Cons:
Sound leakage
90 degree rotation instead of 180 degree (and the 90 degree is in the wrong direction, going outward instead of toward the chest)
Weak bass response without an amp
Slight distortion at reasonable listening volume
I will be reordering the Sennheiser 380HD Pro's for only $30 more.  No comparison on sound quality. ATH-M50X may be good, but many complaints about comfort.  Read the reviews.

"Alright so I've had this pedal for a few months now and it is still my favorite pedal on my board. The Voyager is awesome for anything low to medium gain. It has three knobs: volume, gain, and tone. Each causes a very noticeable change, giving you a wide array of sounds. Depending on what you want to get from it, you can get anything from a (nearly) clean boost to a gritty, chunky overdrive. The pedal itself is very sturdy and it doesn't effect your tone hardly at all. Also, it is better to use a straight 9v adapter rather than an L-shaped because the jack is a little bit inside the casing. If you plan on velcroing it to your board, it comes with a completely flat bottom, if not there are stick-on rubber feet that come in the box. It also comes with two Walrus Audio picks and a Walrus Audio sticker.

I've been able to use this both when playing lead at my church and when going for more of a rock sound with my band. Overall, Voyager is the best overdrive I own and is a great pedal.

Pros: Wide array of sounds, Great tone, sturdy construction, Looks good
Cons: The click is a tiny bit loud when you turn it on

"I am writing this as an offset to the only other review which I found here on Amazon, which bombed this fine mixer.  I'm offended.  I can certainly agree that the other fellow had a bad experience - here's the 'other side' for what it's worth:

I bought this mixer about five years ago to use with my Dell XPS9000 i7 PC as a platform for Cubase to record and mix sound from my Tyros3 Arranger Keyboard plus vocals and guitar.

In addition, I use it as a mixer for my PC on a daily basis, controlling a pair of Rokit 8 powered studio monitor speakers and the matching Rokit 10s Powered Subwoofer.  I run Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit) and the Steinberg drivers (on their website) work perfectly and reliably.  Latency is not an issue with this device and Cubase 5.  The device does not add unwanted background hum to the recordings, very important for studio work!

The key to this hardware is having the right firewire card in your PC.  Many of today's PCs lack Firewire (excluding APPLE) connectors, and those that DO have Firewire port built-in oftentimes have the wrong Firewire chipset on the PC motherboard, which causes havoc with many audio hardware devices, this one included!  Therefore, I recommend the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SIIG-FireWire-2-Port-PCIe-NN-E20012-S2/dp/B000G6U8VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SIIG FireWire 2-Port PCIe (NN-E20012-S2)</a>as an add-in Firewire adapter (requires 1 standard x1 PCIe slot).  The Steinberg MR816-CSX absolutely, positively, is 'picky' about the Firewire chipset used to interface with the PC and the Steinberg unit.  The MR816-CSX works best with Texas Instruments' chipsets - and I can personally attest that TI (Texas Instruments) is a key factor to your end user experience with this mixer.  The SIIG card I mention in this article has a 5-volt white 4-pin MOLEX connector to bring additional power to the Firewire channel over and above the power coming through the PCI bus.  YOU NEED TO CONNECT the Molex to your PC power supply - if you don't the MR816-CSX will exhibit the ""lost connections"" that the other reviewer cried about.  Learned the hard way.  Connected the Molex supplemental power, life was good, and the mixer was all I ever hoped for.  Clean, pure, easy to operate, XLR connectors... great value for the special price Amazon is offering it at.

I run my MR816-CSX mixer 24x7, and have done so for the past five years!  Every day - all day and all night, it's on... and it never drops connections, is hum-free and IMHO very high quality for the money.

Great mixer.",5.0

"I bought this unit hoping it would have some good pipe organ sounds. Casio seems to be known for their organ sounds so thought I'd give this one a shot. This unit did not work for me the way I'd hoped, but what do you expect for a $500 workstation? I was specifically looking for a good pipe organ sound, which this does not have. If you want quality sounds, your best bet is either Korg, Roland, or Yamaha workstations. And don't go for the cheapest model as you won't be very happy with them. You can expect to spend at least $600 for quality sounds. I gave this 2 stars because there is one thing this keyboard does very well. It is very accessible to a blind person. Not many keyboards can claim this as most now use touch screens. In fact, the only other keyboards I've found with this level or better accessibility is this one, the Kurzweil units, the Yamaha MoXF, and some of the Yamaha Psr-S series. I don't have experience with the Motif, so can't comment on its accessibility. However, many blind musicians have this instrument and can't live without it.

"I have the DJ200AB-A1B TENOR Classical Guitar Tuners on a Flamenco guitar.  The tuning response is excellent. The gears are snug and react to the slightest turn.  The feel of the Tenors is that of  more expensive tuners. They are solid quality construction.  The plates, for instance, are at least 1.5 mm thick. And, they have a very nice design.  It takes about 30 minutes to install the tuners (including cleaning the guitar and installing new strings).  In my case, the tuners fit the existing screw holes, so I did not need new screw holes.  The tuning pegs are standard separation and they just slip right in.  Check the diagram provided by the seller for the fit on your guitar. I chose the Tenors for the beautiful design and screw hole placement. I got excellent quality tuners at a very reasonable price.  Suggestion: if you need to make new screw holes use an awl or a small hand drill. Its too easy to drill through with a power drill!!",5.0

"This cased actually bummed me out enough to write my first review.

I did not get the case pictured. The outline of the bass is MUCH more defined. A near perfect outline of a righty P-Bass, so it does NOT look like a lefty would fit. Also it's ""compartments"" are just rectangular dents in the bottom of the case with no flaps/doors covering them. I guess it's ok for a chord or two, or a pack of strings but nothing that would need to be too secure.

My main problem, as another reviewer stated, is that the top of the case hits the volume and tone knobs of my P-Bass before the case is fully closed, making you have to apply a bit more pressure than I am fully comfortable doing in order to lock it. I would have returned it, but I got it just in time to hit the road so I was kinda stuck and just with it.

It's already forming two round dents where the knobs are, hopefully it will just hold the bass in that much more tightly, and won't screw with the knobs too much. Otherwise I am considering cutting out a small rectangle in the top of the case in order for the knobs to have room.  Seems a pretty silly design flaw.

Otherwise it seems sturdy enough... though the outer part seems more squishy and less tough than other Fender hard cases I've seen. Theres already dents and marks in it just from having a guitar in a hard case atop of it for a few hours in a van.

Overall I would not recommend it.",2.0

My only gripe with this is the same problem others have had, which is that the pedal does move slowly backwards as its used if you have it on carpet. This could probably be fixed by attaching the pedal to something, but I personally haven't gotten around to anything like that yet.

Overall, great buy for the price.",4.0

"I can't say enough about EarthQuaker Devices. Their pedals are AWESOME! The Dispatch Master is a Delay and Reverb pedal. The power is on the right side next to the ""IN"". There are 4 dials: Reverb, Repeats, Mix, Time. The Reverb is obviously for the reverb. Turning the dial clockwise gives you more reverb; counter-clockwise, less. The reverb sounds great and many times I have used this pedal as just a reverb pedal. Repeats is how many times the delay will repeat itself from 0 to ALOT. I can't remember off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure even when the repeats is turned all the way up it still dies out, eventually. the Mix dial is how loud the playback is with 12 O'clock being about the same loudness as the playing. So going over that point the playback will be louder, under that point it will be quieter. The time dial is how fast or how slow the delay will happen. This is the dial you would use to sync it with other music. BPM...
So the reason I bought this pedal was so I could use the delay and reverb together to get an ambient sound and to do ambient swells and let me tell you, this pedal is AMAZING for that as well as everything else. If anyone wanted get the ambient sounds but didn't have a lot of money to buy delay pedals, reverb pedals, and all the other pedals, this would be the way to go. Well, this and a volume pedal but that is all that is needed. I absolutely recommend this pedal to anyone looking for this type of sound. Actually, I would recommend this pedal for anyone's pedal board. You could single out the reverb or delay and still have a great pedal.",5.0

It you ONLY want to shield the control cavity of ONE Stratocaster and DO NOT have to shield the pickguard. This product is fine. HOWEVER, I was halfway through the job when I realized my new Pickguard did not have shielding at all,  it is an eight hole 1950's model pickguard that is not original to my strat so I really never paid it attention. The point of the entire endeavor is to build a Faraday cage. this means the electronics are grounded to the copper and the copper makes a full seal around all electronics; so you want to totally encase wires pots and caps in the copper. This particular product does not come with enough product for a total job to be done. A much better option can be found in the link.

"Christmas gift from Santa.  The flash drive that came with the unit doesn't work at all.  Have tried it on PC and Mac and neither recognizes it.  Alternatively we have been attempting to use the mobile app which will send audio to the unit via bluetooth.  It will not send video as it does not come with a docking station.  You will need to use the Ipad for the video/lyrics.  Inconvenient, but not a deal breaker.

Far worse is the fact that the app is incredibly slow.  I tested my Ipad connection with youtube and netflix and both were very fast, but most songs on the singing machine app take 10 minutes or more to load.  Some never load.  I suspect that the app was not designed/prepared for all the traffic on Christmas Day.  This machine was sold at Costco over the holiday shopping season.  I suspect the company out kicked its coverage.

One other word of warning.  Although I could not get anything out of the flash drive I noted the specifications to load the software.  The program is an absolute beast.  Make sure you have a recent computer running on the most recent operating system or you will not be able to install.  The specifications are not stated on the outside of the box

"I originally bought this product to root my Gemini GMX DJ Controller through Traktor Scratch so I could record my mixes directly into either a wave editor software, Propellerhead Reason 9 or Steinberg Cubase 9 for polishing. I also wanted something that would convert tapes and vinyl to digital format so that again I could remaster them through my production software.

At first I admit I was a bit adamant if this would work due to its size and only having two inputs and outputs on the unit. Furthermore, I did try and research on Youtube if any other DJ's who use DJ Controllers had done a video review but was disappointed that most of the videos were pointless unboxing with no real testing to show how it works.

On my testing this worked absolutely fantastic and I am highly pleased with the result. I even tested this through NCH Mixpad and it works like a charm. Behringer do supply a decent range of beginners software to download on their website. However, for those of us who are more seasoned in Music Technology, DJing and producing music, the unit itself is worth the money.

I am also pleased with the size of this unit as it fits nicely along with the leads away into a kit bag with no fuss or complications. I also noticed that when I had it set-up to my laptop, DJ controller, and speakers, it lay nicely to one side and was not in the way. Furthermore, I could plug my headphones into the unit and could hear me mixing on my DJ controller which was also a nice surprise as it meant that my headphone wire could be tucked away safely.

This was pretty easy to install and really helps the piano stand become more rigid.  The pedals have smooth operation and work just fine.  The cord that goes from the foot pedals to the keyboard is long enough so it can be attached along the sides of pedal assembly etc all the way to where it plugs in.  That way it is mostly out of sight.  The pedal size and spacing feels very similar to my grand piano.  Be sure to read the details in the instructions or it may not get installed as well as it could be.  Its easy though.,4.0
I have one of these and I love it.  This past summer my granddaughters came to visit and had a great time picking out tunes on my keyboard.

"The Suzuki Promaster is now my favorite harmonica.  I am no professional, but not a beginner either.  I am used to playing Hohners, and this harp blew me away with its responsiveness.  The tone is full and a good volume, but can be played softly as well.  Because I am not excellent at the harp, I still have issues with my technique, which the Suzuki is more sensitive to then the Hohners.  In the two weeks and a half I have had the Suzuki, it has helped me to know what I am doing wrong, and now my technique is much better.  This is a nice and heavy harp too, it will not blow away in the wind.  It is easy to clean and looks great.",5.0

"Of all the myriad choices one has when selecting a strap lock system for guitar or bass, there is one choice that is head and shoulders above the rest. It is the DiMarzio system. This is the 3rd strap I've ordered, for the third guitar. Out of all the systems I've seen, DiMarzio is the most secure, and easiest to use.

The strap lock system comes with everything you need to install it as far as hardware (washers, screws, and bushings). All you need is a Phillip's head screwdriver. They even include two separate sets of hardware; chrome for Fender instruments, and black for Ibanez and other more modern builds of guitar. The black hardware screws are slightly bigger in diameter. In both cases the screws are longer than the screws that come installed in the guitar, so that the DiMarzio screws will have be more secure. The strap material is the same exact material used in automotive seat belts. On one hand, this makes the strap ridiculously strong, while on the other hand, the strap is actually quite slick, and so the strap will slide around on your shoulder if you give it a chance. If you have a neck-heavy guitar, the strap will allow the neck to droop down if you aren't holding it. Also, the strap is only 2"" wide, so a heavy guitar will cause it to cut into your shoulder after an extended period. Consider the 3"" version of this strap, it really helps with the heavier instruments.

The clips are of tough, high-density plastic. Have no fear, they will support far more than the weight of your guitar, even if you are super energetic when you play, the guitar isn't going anywhere. Have you ever seen a guitar player successfully do a full-body, behind the back swing of their guitar? There is an 80-90% chance that that particular player has this very strap lock system installed.

To add to the already impressive awesomeness of this strap lock system, consider that they come in a wide variety of colors, I bought one in bright green and it is just the bee's knees. Very visually striking. Yngwie Malmsteen uses one, so it's more than enough for me!

PROS:
+ Very easy install (instructions included), only a Phillip's head (+) screwdriver necessary
+ Super secure once installed
+ Comfortable
+ Quality hardware included
+ Many colors and patterns available

CONS:
- If you have a heavy guitar, the 2"" strap can cut into the shoulder after a while. For heavier guitars and basses, go with the 3"" strap
- The material of the strap is car seat belt material, and is slick. A neck-heavy guitar will droop down if you aren't holding the neck up.",5.0

"As a touring musician, and playing bass for 16yrs, this is one of the best basses I've played. To give a little background info, I've played many basses over the years. Everything from Ibanez 505(my first bass) to Pedulla, Zon, MusicMan, Fender, Warwick, and all the usual. This is the best IMO out of them all. It has the best tone, the B sings, and the best neck. Hardly have to adjust the neck on tour, vs the rest of them this bass had to be adjusted the least. Zon was second best of course, but didn't like the tone. The Hanson pickups are good on here as well as the Lakland LH3 preamp. The tones you can get from this bass are excellent, and vary dramatically. Basically you can get every tone under the sun, but it still has that 3d type of dimension to the sound. Yes the body is made and neck are made out of country, then shipped back to Chicago and everything else is done there. The only difference between this bass and the 55-94($4000) is that the body and neck are made here in Chicago. Also got a chance to tour the facility's in Chicago, and the people who work there are awesome and extremely dedicated. Was there when they where shaping asking questions. And was asked polity to keep quiet while he finished his work. Then he stopped and answered my questions. He didn't want to get distracted from what he was doing, which in my eyes show's real determination to his craft. And that just says something right there. Oh and this bass stays in tune as well. Hardly have to adjust it when it's set with new strings. Really can't say enough good things about this bass. No I don't work for Lakland nor am I endorsed by them, just love these basses and am a real tone head, so when I find something that's awesome I'm awed by it cause it doesn't happen often anymore.",5.0
New MIM Strat into a Blue Jr tweed:  I tried Texas Specials to no avail.  Dropped in a set of the Fat 50s.  Great tone. I am ecstatic.  Only thing I need to do is jump a wire so I can have tone control on the bridge pickup and take a little bite off.  I got many compliments on my sound at a loud blues jam the first time out  Almost hated to use a drive pedal the clean sound was so nice.,5.0
"I've owned the C-2s for about a year now and I have say I reach for them more than almost any other mic I own (the winner would have to be the Blue Baby Bottle because it's just so dang versatile!). A little bit about my context: I'm a full time music technology educator, performer and composer. In terms of time breakdown, those three roles end up being around 70/20/10. I've used the C-2s to record guitar with students, mic choirs for school performances and even to capture room noise for in-ear monitors during performances. Here's what I like:

-The cost to performance ratio is outstanding. They fall in the bottom of the cost range but offer a performance which is entirely usable in a variety of contexts. Would I use them for a classical guitar recording? No, but any studio you go to is going to have an excellent SDC. The C-2s also come with wind screens, mic clips and a stereo mount.

-The durability is also outstanding. Working with students (as you teachers out there know) means you occasionally get the ""oops, I dropped it!"" or ""I think the stand just fell over"". With the C-2s, I haven't had anything shatter, crack or disintegrate yet. They survive being tossed in my gear bag (a repurposed husky tool bag), transported to and from gigs (latin dance band) and handled by students of all ages.

Here's what I don't like:

-The sensitivity of the mic is difficult to control using gain. What I mean is that in applications where the source of the sound is static or you want to either capture sound or not capture sound, the C-2s shine. But I haven't found them to be very nuanced in terms of picking up dynamic changes. I adjust the gain to get a good signal and then from there on out it's either ""we got it!"" or ""we can't hear it"". For me, this makes them more usable in live/on-stage applications than for recording.

My recommendation? If you want a mic which costs next to nothing, delivers durability and predictable results, the C-2s are for you. Classroom use, technology teaching, reference/scratch recordings and live performance are areas where the C-2s shine. If you want a mic to create an outstanding guitar recording or choral recording for submission for contests or sale online, I'd strong recommend looking elsewhere (the Avantone CK-1, for example).",5.0
"These are the best electric guitar strings in the world.  I was convinced to try a pack from a local vendor and now all of my guitars are graced with these.  Over 10 years now.

However, at the very front of my chain of seven true-bypass devices and a Boss RC-3 looper at the very end, this unit was completely unnecessary and actually garfed up my sound a little bit.

Since Boss pedals have their own buffer (and I will never own one other than the estimable RC-3), I suspect that it is buffering the sound as it heads toward my amp (everything is chained in front - no effects loop). No harm, no foul. I'll keep this until the day that I might need it (in the unlikely event that I wind up with 20 damn pedals on my board).",3.0

"I have been playing guitar for well over 30 years and I would not buy this for myself. This guitar is acceptable as it sounds OK for the price and plays alright, but it is build cutting corners. The tuning knobs don't turn smoothly, the neck finish is rather uneven with paint runs and ragged edges. The pegs holding the strings fit  VERY loose and when I installed new (better) strings they had a tendency to pull out while tightening. I struggled to keep them seated while tuning the strings. That explains why the guitar does not stay in tune very well. Installing better fitting pegs may solve this issue. I purchased the guitar as a gift to a beginning player and she is happy with it. I would recommended spending a bit more money on an instrument of higher quality.",3.0

"I was looking for an electric kit that I could play anytime without disturbing the rest of my house. I saw this one, as it is very eye catching, and I researched it a bit and it seemed fine. I got it and it got to my house today so I set it up. It took an hour or two to set up fully, two hours definitely with wiring and setting up the module, and it looked nice once it was set up. The rack was one part I was worried about. It is not extremely sturdy, going by the fact that it lifts up a lot, and it is hard to get it perfectly level because the feet are small. Another part I was worried about was the kick trigger. Because it's not part of the actual rack, it slid everywhere while I was positioning it, while on a carpet with the pegs all the way down. I was stuck putting an old guitar amp behind it so it stopped moving. As soon as the rack was set up, it looked tiny. The whole kit is very small once set up, but that may be a good thing for some people. The last thing I'll talk about is the module, which I don't like. It has no good real-drum sounds, along with most of the sounds it makes aren't great. Also the time between when you hit a drum and when the sound plays is too noticeable for drumming. Overall, I would not recommend this kit to anyone that is expecting much. If you want a standard electric drum kit, go for it.

"Many of the other reviews give me the impression that the keys in this recorder were not present when they bought it, mine has keys, which make the low notes easy to play (mine says YRT-304B II rather than YRT-304B).  Speaking of low notes, I own 3 tenors, and the Yamaha 300 low notes are by far the loudest (for a tenor recorder), very beautiful sound (check YouTube videos for a number of good examples, that's how I decided on buying).

On the other hand, if you play tenor, you are probably a skillful player who can play throughout the entire register of a recorder.  If you do that on this one, you will be disappointed with the higher notes on this recorder.  All three 300 series recorders (soprano, alto, and tenor) have significant tuning issues in the high register, but you can compensate on the first two by using uncomfortable fingerings.  On the tenor, the high notes that are out of tune cannot be fixed with any fingerings, as far as I have been able to determine.  YMMV.

You will need the soapy water trick on this recorder, it does get clogged, but the trick works very well to prevent this.",3.0

"Excellent pedal!!!!  Best reverb out there!  I'd give it five stars if it had the no-click switch that the mini version has.

I own two of these and two of the mini versions if that tells you how much I like the product. I own other nice reverb pedals too but they stay on the shelf while this pedal actually gets used.

Also, I don't know how to quantify this exactly but there is a noticeable tone improvement when you switch it on.  That's why I have two on my board at one time.  One has a subtle setting that stays on all the time and the second has a very wet setting I can engage for special occasions.

Tone print is amazing too.",4.0

"I had been pondering my options with my iPad mini with retina display (I know, lighting port...more on that later).  I had been using a usb hub to connect a separate midi adapter and audio interface to my iPad...as I've found it WONDERFUL for using as a synthesizer/sound source for music and live performance.  I'd known about this particular item, and also it's several competitors (iodock, behringer's competing item, and some of the standalone audio interfaces)...but I could not pull the trigger on any of these for fear of disappointments or outright rejection/failure in my use/application.  When the price of the Studio connect coming down (due to the 30-pin connector, and the replacement version with the lightning cable)....I finally decided to give this a shot.

First-if you're thinking you'll save money by buying this and getting a cheap 30 pin/lightning adapter-NOPE.  Okay, you'll save about ten bucks or so.  I paid the apple tax and I'm not excited by that, but it made the StudioConnect work well.

FUNCTION:  As a dock-it's wonderful!  It sits on my studio desk and allows me to use the iPad, connected to audio and MIDI, and it CHARGES MY iPAD while it's plugged in!  As an interface?  I could not be happier.  Great audio quality through the RCA jacks, audio in works, and MIDI timing is accurate.  However, the big silver knob is of no use to me-when you turn it, it doesn't do anything except for freeze up the unit (a simple power cycle brings it back within about 7 seconds).  Bad? No...but useful knowledge if you purchase one.  Oh...and if you have a lightning port iPad and use a cover for it?  Save yourself the trouble of modding the cover-buy yourself the lighting adapter model (that cable is hard-wired into the unit, and cannot be replaced, and with the 30pin/lightning adapter-you'll be hard pressed to find a case that will work out of the box.  I modded my cover to allow for protection and clearance)

  After using this to replace the mess of wires and the hub I had been using, this is a great, time-saving solution to an issue for music makers who want to use their iPad in the studio and on the stage.  My good friend bought one on my recommendation, and he's extremely happy with it.  Plug it in to a power source, plug all your cabling in...and get to work!  It's great for the price I paid for it.",5.0

"So I tried the round sound hole type humidifier. I'm not here to run down anyone's product but It just wouldn't keep my guitar humidified within the specs of 45-55% relative humidity. I use a hygrometer in the case and the relative humidity was running below 30%. I didn't have problems with leakage, sound hole damage, installation or anything else with this product.

So then I came across the Humitar. I really didn't like the idea of cramming something between the strings of my guitar, even though these products are designed to be used this way. So I bought one with the intent of hopefully coming up with a plan. I used it in the ""normal"" way (cramming it between the strings) and the relative humidity was within specs.

Then I thought of slipping the Humitar between the edge of the sound hole and the strings and it stays there perfectly! It doesn't matter if you slip it between the edge of the sound hole and the high or low E string.
If you keep your guitar stored flat on its back it will rest at a slight angle as the first picture shows and if you keep you guitar stored on its edge it will rest level as the second picture shows.

I have tried using it both ways and have not have any problems with leakage, slippage. damage to the edge of the sound hole or anything else.",5.0

Now I can not sleep sometime at night so I wake up and play this digi piano (better than try to stay in bed, am I right?). All good things as other people review plus I can link to 3 best software in the market (IMHO,another $100); Notation Composer, Synthesia and PrestoKey by USB to my computer (win 7 64 bits) and all work like a charm on my digi piano.
The one point that they did not really point out is weight (mention but not much), it is heavy (or very heavy for old guy like me). X stand can be used but it is not really secure.
I end up by buying CS44 stand for it. In my case it should be 399+119 = $518 (but I pay less due to some discount, not at Amazon ..sorry) at this price (may + $$) you may go lighter high end keyboard or better keyboard with stand.

"If you set up cables in a studio to leave permanently, then you probably ought to get gold-plated fittings to keep the connection free of any corrosion. But if you are working remotely, setting up gear then striking it, setting it up again somewhere else, and repeating on a regular basis, then you need these colored cables. The constant friction on the metal parts will keep the contacts conducting, though I haven't seen any evidence of corrosion or wear after two years.

It's hard to label cables for every use, and even if you number them, the numbers on the far end don't do you much good unless you go over there and read them periodically. The most practical solution I know of is color. Run your cables in pairs of complimentary colors. Using a mnemonic, you'll always know which cable is in which channel. The mnemonic I use is from boats navigation on water: ""Red, Right, Returning."" That applies to electronics and audio just as well. So, Red is the Right channel of the first stereo color pair, and Green is the Left. That normally would mean that Green is Channel 1, Red is Channel 2.

Next on the color wheel would be Orange, whose complimentary color, Purple, would be the Left channel, or channel 3. Thus Orange is the Right channel of that pair, which would make it channel 4. Then you've got Blue for the Left channel of the last pair, channel 5, and Yellow for channel 6, Right.

The warm colors are all Right channels, and the cool colors are Left channels. Even if you're running them monophonically, pairing them that way helps you to keep them straight in your mind. Your label on the mixer (or in your DAW) would read something like Lead Vocal M149 Green; Guitar AKG414 Red; Surface-Tom U89 Purple; Under-Tom AKG414 Orange; and so forth, listing the purpose, the mic, and the color.

Work never was so simple! These cables have proven helpful beyond belief for location recording, but I use them in the studio, too. I keep them coiled nicely so that there is no spaghetti mess.

I lowered the rating by one star, because the hardware is not gold-plated. Yes, I knew that before I bought them, and no, I don't really care, but most gold-plated hardware does seem to fit together more easily, as well as giving you peace of mind that all connections are working without error, but honestly I have no reason to suspect these cables of operating otherwise. But why not go all the way and plate them in gold?

I'm careful with cables and hardware, so I haven't had any problem with wear. Will edit post if things change. By the way, I wouldn't use these in conspicuous places on stage. Black looks better. But for all places that are less visible to the audience, these are fine.",4.0

"If you're looking for a cheap guitar that sounds good then this is a good buy.  The guitar has nice tones with distortion but doesn't sound as good clean.  You will probably have to raise the action hight on the bottum two strings (A & E), as they tend to buzz on the frets alot. Other than that the playability is fine.
  The guitar has a beautiful finish but doesn't really look like a les paul outside of the general body shape.  Unlike a real les paul, the top of the body is completely flat and doesn't feature the white outline.  Also, the head stock says ""Special model"" rather than ""Les Paul model"".  This is a great guitar if you only care about the sound but if you want the look of a les paul it's better to go for an Epi LP 100 or LP Standard.",4.0
"This is hands down the best mini-head for classic rock.  IMO, it is a loud 20 watts that you can gig with in a 3-piece. I used to own a 20W Mesa Boogie Subway Rocket and this is as loud as that, and I gigged fine with a loud 5 piece (rhythm, lead, bass, drums, keyboard). Of course, you can always mic it if your band is too loud.  As for the tone, it's is AWESOME. People complain about the clean channel (rhythm) not being Fender, of course notnothing beats a blackface reverb clean, but it's great as it is.  Just keep the pre-gain 12 noon and under, and at 20 watts you have some nice headroom.  I like the crunch switch in the clean channel, which adds touch sensitive break up, which is perfect for classic rock and blues. There's also a switch for a Marshall voicing on the rhythm channel, which does a good job of imitation.  So for your jazz, blues, and classic rock, the rhythm channel is where you'll live.

Now where the amp shines, of course, is the lead channel.  Distortion up the wazoo to play ANY style of metal. I won't review that channel because others have already done so. But the lead channel is EXCELLENT.  Best metal amp ever.

In summary, the Peavey 6505MH is a Jack of All Trades, MASTER OF ALL amp. Get it.

Get a good cabinet though. If you play metal you'll want something like the 1x12 closed back Mesa-Boogie Rectifier cabinet, which adds more punch to the mids and bass (I'm assuming you play metal). That cabinet is way heavier than the head, which weighs almost nothing.

Before I leave, I have to give Kudos to Amazon Fulfillment.  Previous to this amp, I ordered from 3rd party music stores, and TWO AMPS IN A ROW were damaged on arrival. These 3rd party clowns didn't pack the amp well, unlike Amazon, which double boxed the amp.

This is The Amp to get for practice, home, recording and occasional gigging. 110% recommended.",5.0

"I started violin in the 6th grade and played all through high school and then off and on since then (total of maybe 21 years) something like that. I love to play and the family violin I played on (Stradivarius copy) had to be loaned to my cousin to use so I had been without one for about 2 years. I was really missing playing and had a very low budget to purchase one but I did a TON of research. Just to give you a sense of the level of playing I am at I play music like Brandenburg Concerto No 3, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Cappricio Espangnole, my favorite being Bach Double Concerto for 2 Violins. The reason for the background on my experience is because I didn't see may reviews from people that had played for a while, mostly entry level and beginners and I wanted to have some credibility for my review. I would never consider myself professional but I am not a beginner. I have had this violin for about a month now and I couldn't be happier. It is certainly NOT my Stradivarius copy, however it is a really great value for the price. It does come with everything you need and I even like the beginning practice book for my warm ups. Has the Can Can, Simple Gifts and comes with the CDs to play along with. The instrument is beautiful, I will most likely replace the strings because they sound a little tinny mostly on the E string it stands out. Maybe some Dominants will fix that. I waited to do the review to make sure I didn't have any issues and I haven't. The one thing that made me click to purchase was the Fiddlermans review. I actually subscribed to his site before I even knew he did a review on a black Cecilio Violin and he was impressed for the money also. I wanted to get my violin ""fix"" so to speak for a good price and that's what this is. I hope this helps anyone considering. Of course if you have more money to spend, by all means get a higher quality. But bottom line is if you know how to play, you can make it sound decent.",5.0

thru my Studio Speakers as well. Does EXACTLY what it PROMISES to do WITHOUT any glitches. Yeah, there's CHEAPER ones
out there to purchase, ONLY to have to replace at a later date, but, if you've spent loads of money on your studio equipment
why have a WEAK LINK in the chain of your studio ? What ya got to lose? Try one and write YOUR OWN comments about it
afterwards. Oh, just so you'll know, there IS one small annoying thing (sorry) there's NO on and off switch on it but,  I'm sure
like I did, you can figure out how to address that small issue. If you're looking for a USB connection to get your gear into your
computer, TRY THIS LEXICON, YOU won't be sorry.",5.0
"This case came in a timely manner. It is a very nice case although I wish it had an outside pocket and maybe it could be a little smaller, my 12 year old son uses it.

"Summary:
Its more than a month since I bought this. I have bought this as a birthday present for my little girl. But it is MUCH BETTER THAN A TOY. Now, I play this almost daily atleast for 5 minutes, just because I LOVE THIS. TO ME THIS IS A GREAT DRUM SET. I have not even started looking into the features of the drum controller. I don't know, may be not for professionals on stage or recording.  But definitely great at home & practice.

About Me: (so that you know how many pinches of salt you need to add to my review)
I am not a trained Jazz drummer, but I am a percussionist trained in Eastern percussion instruments(Tabla for those who know). I used to play in bands(not in US). So trust me, I may not be an expert about Jazz Drums, but I am not bad either :) .

Purchase: I didn't buy this from amazon. I was looking for a good drums as my daughters birthday present. I didn't buy this one earlier because of the negative reviews I have read. So thinking that at a slightly higher price, I maybe able to find a decent ones, I went around few local drums & musical instruments shops. The cheapest electronic drum I found was $599. So, I decided to sacrifice my desire for a good one and make the 3year old happy(for whom this was originally intended). From my earlier visits, I knew that my local target store had this @ $229. To my luck this one was marked down to $160 on the day. But Trust me, It is a Great one even at the full price.

Why the review:
The negative review kept me away from this in the first place. After a month of use, i feel this is not as bad it is seen in many other reviews. Thats the reason why I decided to write this review(Now I am shopping around for the extra pads). I am giving it a 5 stars even with the minor gripes i have listed below because its well worth the money.

The good:
- Very much affordable even at the full price. Much lower than any other electronic drum set.
- Comes with an excellent Drum machine which has tons of options as per the user guide. I didn't get time to explore them though.
- The drum machine(controller) has 9 inputs and one hihat and one kick pedal controller for expansion.

Not bad, but could be improved:
- Frame. Not Rock Solid. It doesn't wobble when I play the drum. But my 3year old girl can still turn the pads with my bare hands even when the nuts are tightened well. again, NOT BAD, but could be improved.
- The pads are not sensitive enough to be used as a hand percussion. Ofcourse this is not sold as a hand percussion, but JUST MY GRIPE.
- Looks. Circular PADS could have been better ! RIM could have helped with Rim Shot to get the feel of real drum. If the shape of cymbals and the Hi Hats could have been closer, the Looks could have improved drastically. Ofcourse they sell a seperate $50 crash cymbals as an optional accessory.
- Tangling cables. The cables could have been arranged better if they are routed through the frame. you can tie it to the frame using a velcro, Wrap & Twist or something similar. But cables routed through the frame would have been an excellent cleanup.

The bad:
- Why only 5 pads in the standard package ? Atleast 6 pads are needed if not 7. With 5 pads your drums ends with 2 Tom-Toms. A bell and claps(smaller pads) could have been great. Ofcourse maybe at a slightly higher price or as an optional accessory pack ? the extra 2 pads are at $50. I am now in amazon to buy that one :) .
- The Kick Pedals give the plastic-ky feel. Slight touch is enough to trigger the pedal. If you practice on this and get on a real drum, your kicks will never reach the real drum. I am thinking of trying the do-it-yourself moddding someone else has mentioned in the review.
- The sticks are loud when they hit the pad !!! I did a quick fix myself by wrapping a small piece of cloth at the tip. It is better now, but not good still. Maybe a silicone tipped stick could be better on this one.",5.0
"Bought this used 4 years ago on Amazon for $39 shipped. It was like brand new. I see it on here now for $149,so I guess I got a sweet deal..Well I know I did,cause this thing kicks ass. Built like a tank. The sounds you can get out of this are incredible. All except the Digitech Metal are crisp and have many variable settings for each mode. I use the Boss metal zone the most,because I play mostly early 80s metal..But the RAT and Boss Distortion have great sounds as well. Muff gives you that Hendrix sound.

I was told by my more experienced guitar playing friends back then,not to get anything Digitech. Let me say that even they are impressed by this pedal. They sound close to the originals,not quite,but damn close. I would recommend it to anyone...Especially if you are just starting out and don't have the money to buy many different pedals. Its all right here for one price.",5.0

"Where have you been all my life. This pedal is beyond perfect. The 'AC' stands for 'Almost Clean' so it is designed to go from clean boost to heavy overdrive. Tone controls on the B channel allow to dial in the perfect freq to cut through the mix with a slight boost/breakup and then use the A channel kick in a fatter/thicker crunch/distortion. if you are looking for a palette of overdrive tones, this is the gold standard. Played most my life with one clean tone and one crunch tone and sure with I could go back in time and have this on my board - (Oh, and buy more stock in Apple). I used the Xotic recommended knob settings and they were perfect!
Oh year, and only takes up one power feed off my pedal board power supply.",5.0

"It comes with a nice carrying pouch and even some tabs for songs to learn. It has a bit of a smell, but I've heard that there are ways of getting rid of that, it personally doesn't bother me. I've noticed a bit of fluctuation with the tone (aka the note you are playing may vary by up to half a step either up or down) depending on how hard you blow, but that may just be due to my lack of expertise as a beginner player myself. Overall, I feel that this is still a good quality instrument to learn from as a beginner.",4.0

"The SKB large drum case is large and is tough as nails. The wheels are truly durable. The case overall is actually heavier than it needs to be, as the bottom half doubles over for about six inches from the upper edge, but that is the level of protection SKB has attempted to build into the case.  The most useless feature of the case is the insert tray, which I find unnecessary and which is almost as heavy by itself as the main (bottom) portion of the case. I threw the insert away, but that leaves two small gaps under the edge of the lid which make me a tad bit nervous.",3.0

The trick to a perfect install is to center the 'tip' of the clamping foot on the center of the neck. It's a revelation when installed correctly!

"My first guitar ever was a tobacco sunburst knock-off Strat that I bought off an aging hippie.  This Silvertone could be that very guitar if it weren't for the fact that it's in pristine mint condition.  $61 for a ""used-acceptable"" guitar from the Amazon Warehouse, and I've gotten every penny.  The guitar came with an allen wrench, whammy bar, and cable.  Too bad they didn't toss a shoulder strap in, but for the price I can customize that option myself.

"I really like the case and the harmonica's are great.

There is a soft velvet like inner top that closes down on the harmonicas when you close the case. It looked like the perfect place to stash notes or something.

"Great lights - have them set up behind my computer monitor and they provide a nice amount of contrast lighting.  The strip is long (39 inches), so be sure it will fit your application - the lights can be cut and daisy chained together, but the process is definitely difficult and harder than with some other lights.  The slew of settings for the lights is nice, especially adjusting the brightness/color scheme.  The USB cord is a functional length, and the light controller works well and is discrete.

The adapter is 120V which doesn't work in most countries as far as I know... I had to buy a Chinese adapter to get the mixer operating..

"This is a perfect 1RU mixer. If you need variety of inputs it offers you can't beat this unit. The phantom power switches for individual channels are rare and a very pro level feature. All of the knobs are smooth and the unit seems to be well built. The labels are easy to read and the overall look its clean and uncluttered. The MX622 would be great for a little mobile setup, or a conference room; anything where your typical inputs are a few mics plus an ipod/cd/computer.  I didn't use the effects return loop but I could see it being useful for a solo act with a microphone, guitar and a re-verb or effects unit.

As noted in the subject the unit does suffer from a turn-off pop. Like other reviewers this is standard on most equipment these days but its definitely not a deal breaker. Just remember BA-AB. Board on amps on, amps off board off and the pop won't matter.",5.0

"Great product from UAD.  After 18 months, its still as good as the first day.  When you think about buying UAD Apollo interfaces, you should consider a long term budget beyond this purchase price.  Why? Because the plugins that really shine are sold separately.  They may be expensive for some budgets, but the value is worthy.  UAD plugins are amazing.  You can demo them for 14 days, and the demos are renewed typically with new purchase/authorization of a plugin or UAD software update.

Pros:
- Solid build.
- Onboard UAD processing saves CPU and reduces increased latency.  This is a major benefit, and you can add Satellite for more processing.
- Console software is versatile. I can route iTunes/System audio through the FX, and even send to DAW via virtual routing.

Cons:
- Front Hi-z input replaces rear input when plugged.  So I can't use my guitar while having my keyboard plugged as stereo 1/4"".  To solve this I bought a Presonus Digimax D8, which allows me to send 8 audio inputs to the Apollo via ADAT.  This has been my solution until my rack unit arrives this week.
- Not bus-powered.  I know this is not possible because of onboard plugin processing. However, I wish there was a way to disable that internal card and just use as interface.
- Separate units for Windows/Mac. My Mac unit is currently not compatible with Windows.  Recently, they released a USB3 version for Windows.

Overall, this is the best compact interface you can get if you have the budget to invest.  I'm all about Thunderbolt, so this was a no-brainer for me.",4.0

However, based upon the price, I thought I'd have to make adjustments to the intonation, fret leveling, and action. But I didn't have to do any of that. I would have given this guitar five stars, but because of the bracing, the laminate, and/or the heavy finish, some notes (especially bass) sound a bit muted and don't sustain very well. But there are ways around that. All in all, I would recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a good classical guitar at a good price.",4.0

"My girlfriend has owned this Takamine for the past three years, during which I've had occasion to play it. During the period, I have also used a Takamine EG341C purchased through Amazon. The 341 is a good value guitar while the 544 is superior on technical grounds. It should be. The 544 costs about twice as much.

In general, I think the 341 is best for beginner to intermediate play. It's a good way to start playing, and a good choice for someone who would like to play casually without making a significant investment. More accomplished players should go with the 544, which will also stand up better to constant use.

The construction of the 544 is clearly superior to the 341. It has a more solid feel to it. The pegs in particular are individually geared and slippage is minimal, whereas the 341 uses the much less expensive 3-in-1 peg strips, and the gearing seems somewhat loose and inaccurate to me.

The finish on the 341 is a glossy black that is attractive enough this although this is clearly a no-frills guitar with little in the way of other finishing touches. The 544 has a natural finish that looks superior to me, and the 544 also has some extra finishing touchs such as fretboard inlays which add to its general attractiveness.

Both have a clear and resonant sound, with the 544 seeming to be a bit fuller to me.

Both come pre-strung with D'Addario strings which are light and easy to finger. Fretboard clearance is ideal in both for a steel-string guitar.

Either guitar represents a fine value depending on your level of play and your overall objectives. If I had it to do over again, I would be very tempted to get the 544 for myself instead of the 341, but I would be doing a lot of pondering over the extra $300. I hope this helps to put the 544 a bit better into context. Good luck.",5.0

broken off of the bell (part of a key stop). Also, when playing some of the lower notes, there was an annoying ""warbling"" sound!  I might

This is one of the best little lights for the buck you can get. The show is great - lights are bright and the patterns are terrific. The grouping is tight so it is very colorful. It has a mount at the top you can hang or mount as needed. The reaction to the sound activation is great. This is the 3rd one I bought because I like them that well. Makes a great show when they are going at same time.,5.0
"The product works as I wanted.  It is double sided with one side being a slightly higher pitch than the other.  I hoped that the block would deliver a lower tone, but it works well as is for songs like ""Evil Ways"" and most of the other songs we play.  It is not made of plastic and delivers an authentic wood sound.  It has good mounting hardware included so it can be put onto a standard size cymbal rod.",5.0
This was a great case. We do mission work at our church in Haiti.  I had bought a keyboard to take over there.  I wanted something that would endure the harsh treatment of the airlines.  I also did not want to spent $400 on a hard shell case.  This case did very well.  It weathered the airlines and the rough conditions of Haiti like a charm.  The keyboard made it safely to all locations completely unharmed.,5.0

"For Ableton Live users, if you are looking for a quick and easy plug and play controller, I can't recommend this. I was hoping for something comparable to Push or Akai controllers. Those are basically plug and play. Not so with the Beatstep. I am bummed, because I was excited to have an inexpensive controller with CV. For a product that is 4 years old, there is not a single video on YouTube made by Arturia showing customers how to set the Beatstep with Ableton Live. The manual is offers no specific DAW setup advice. There are people BEGGING for help on forums and in comments sections for years. Nothing, aside from a Beatstep Pro video which doesn't help Beatstep owners much. It seems amazing to me that a company would invest so much time and effort developing a product with so little customer support. Arturia: Are you folks reading the comment sections and reviews and trying to serve your customers at all?

If you are going to make an entry level product, shouldn't you offer entry level support? Otherwise, people would all buy Push 2 and be happy as clams.",2.0

"I have this guitar in tobacco sunburst and it is a beautiful guitar. This is the GA101 model with brass frets and a black painted fretboard. Plastic nut and saddle as well as non rosewood bridge. I got this guitar off ebay three yrs. ago for fifty bucks it was packaged well and arrived with no issues (broken strings,broken neck ect.)it has an adjustable truss rod and comes with truss rod tools. I bought just the guitar so I can't say about the other stuff in pack other than buy a good electronic tuner and a good gig bag. The action out of the box was unplayable high and I had to adjust the action by sanding down the saddle. The guitar has a C shape neck and is like that of a Fender. Sound is tinny somewhat but not bad. I changed the strings to light gauge and sounds alot better. This is a beater guitar and nothing more or a poor mans starter guitar that is worth the money and getting you started learning to play. The neck has no sharp frets or fret buzz,neck is strait no bows. This is a laminated spruce top easy to take care of no need for a humidifier. This is a good travel beater guitar to take when you don't want to ruin your good ones if it gets lost or stollen your not out alot of cash. I have since moved on and upgraded to an Ibanez IJV50 that is miles better than this one in sound and quality. This guitar got me started on acoustic when I didn't have alot of cash at the time and was worth it and served it's purpose for me to learn on. I recently sold the guitar to a friend who's 23 yr. old son is learning on it now and likes it. I do recommend this guitar if your short on cash or need an acoustic in an emergency buy this it is better than any First Act,Maestro(Gibson),Pyle Pro,J.B.Player or Walmart,Costco,Best Buy guitar.",3.0

"This gig bag is a must-have for the SKB FootNote Pedalboard.

It is grossly underrated at the time of this ""review"" (and hence, the reason for my first review).

Pros:

- It is well made.

- It is a nice, Perfect snug fit, with a velour(-ish) covered styrofoam(?) piece that matches and supports the speaker end of the pedalboard.

- It does allow you to leave your pedals on the board (assuming you have velcro on them, of course!).

- No problems or pedal clearance issues with leaving your FootNote in the bag while you play (the front/top/handle end of the bag is 1""-2"" away from, and about halfway up the side of any pedals installed at the low end of the pedalboard).

- It comes with a detachable shoulder strap (actually, you have to detach it to open the bag fully, as each end of the strap hooks to a different side of the bag).

- The outside pocket is handy for stowing a cable (and the aforementioned shoulder strap), sheet music, etc.

- It does exactly what any gig bag is supposed to do... make it easy to carry an item, while protecting it from (very) minor bumps.

- Price!  At the time of my purchase, it could easily be had via Amazon for $24.95 + shipping.  At that price, it's a ""no-brainer"" purchase for an SKB FootNote Pedalboard owner (even if the single bad rating to date, was a normal situation for the bag!).

Cons:

- The only con I can think of is that SKB could have made a space in the support piece to stow the FootNote's 9v adapter. You'll have to get creative here, if you need to bring the adapter.

Summary:

Buy it. Buy it now. Buy it yesterday, if you have an SKB FootNote pedalboard!",5.0

"This is a pretty loud ukulele which is good. I like a lot of things about it, especially that it is durable and waterproof since it is made if plastic. A few things I noticed that made me remove a star were that either the frets aren't raised very high or the string is too high because you have to hold down your fingers pretty hard to get a chord. Also, and this may simply be an issue with the strings that the ukulele come with, it doesn't ring as long as nicer ukuleles and even other cheap ones that I have used ring longer than yhis one. If you aren't an experienced player, you probably won't notice or care about that too much though. Despite the few negatives, this may be the best deal you can get for a ukulele around $30-$35.",4.0

"I was really excited about getting this guitar for my daughter, especially because of all the other great reviews, the Oscar Schmidt reputation, and because she loves the color blue!  But when it arrived, I tuned it and tried to play it, and the 3 lowest notes (E, A, D) sounded awful.  Basically what I think was happening is that the strings are literally scraping against some piece of metal (possibly a fret bar), so it makes this awful clinking/clanking vibrating sound while the note is playing.  It's hard to describe, but I've never heard this kind of noise from any other guitar.  I thought that certainly this must be a manufacturing defect, so I exchanged it for another one (exact same brand/model).  But the same problem happened with the new guitar that arrived as well.  Now I'm not quite sure what to do.  I'm really surprised that other folks have commented about how great this guitar sounds.  I'm really disappointed.",2.0

It seems heavy to me, but he informs me it is quite light compared to most amplifiers he's owned over the years. He also claims that it provides a sound quality that far exceeds many models that are much more expensive.

This amplifier is additionally made quite portable because it comes with rechargeable batteries. With a three-hour charge, they last up to six hours, which is better than the charge for the batteries in most laptops we've owned.

You can hit it very hard and need to to get its best tones. It has a very comfortable rim and playing surface. The cow skin head is also of high quality. Its a nice break from playing djembe all the time. I will play it regularly in drum circles and acoustic gigs.

The good news is the audio quality is really good even when I turned the input setting on my mac computer all the way up there was no cracking or external noise. The big issue for me and why I ended up returning the headset is that it just would not stay on my ear. We tried everything and finally had to tape it to my body to stick.

"A good value for the price and it looks good. The tone is very good and if properly set up it's is a pleasure to play. But it must be set up by someone who knows how to work on Ovations. As they come from the factory the action will be too high. Your guitar tech will need to lower the bridge and adjust the truss rod to your preferred height. Once that is done you are good for a long time unless you take it out in very cold/dry or very hot/wet weather. For those occasions, learn how to adjust your own action. After a proper set up your adjustments will be small. Then you will have an affordable great sounding instrument that will give you years of enjoyment.

I especially like the option to switch from acoustic to electric easily. The piezo pickups are very sensitive and with a good amp the effect is amazing. No, it's not a Tele, Strat or SG. It has it's own sound with a lot of resonance and still an acoustic character. Be careful with locating speakers and guitar, it can produce an unreal amount of feedback if you stand in the wrong place but it also can give a very full sound.

they had a super cheap one at mid range and a deluxe one. mid range i thought would work best.

i think this could be with all fluids, but it left our downstairs hardwood with an oily texture. a pretty thick layer. i tried placing a smaller microfiber towel right in front of it but that didn't help. the unit was on the floor.

the next party i placed it higher, but still it leaves a slippery aftermath. it doesnt really bother too much since we have to mop after a party anyways. but if you have carpet you might want to figure out a good placement like a kitchen or outside blowing inside through tubes.

"By Stephen Pate  Unless your guitar is a campfire cheapo, it needs humidification during the heating season. Its one of those annoying things to do in winter like wear your mits and hat on cold days.

We had a late start to winter in Prince Edward Island, Canada but the heat has been on steady for a few weeks and the air in the house is dry. That means my beloved guitars are drying out. The tops, back and sides shrink, the Fretboard shrinks and the guitar goes into distress. Ive seen it all including split necks, the bridge lifting and ugly cracks in the back and top.

A dry guitar sounds dull, dead not like the guitar you played last summer. You can prove this if you audition good guitars in a store with a humidified guitar room and one without. Even awesome guitars sound dead if they are dry.

The damage to the thin woods in your guitar does not normally happen over one winter but before long you will start to see the damage. That being said, a new guitar can get damaged in one dry winter.

Your frets will feel sharp on the ends because the wood in the fretboard is shrinking. The bridge will start to lift. First the wood bows out then the glue joints start to give way.

Guitars need at about 45% relative humidity to keep the wood in tone, the joints glued and the guitar from being destroyed over time.

The other side of being dry is also bad  too much humidity can be more damaging. I was in the Moncton, NB Long and McQuade guitar store last week and the smell of mold in the air told me they had the humidity too high. One quick look at the humidifier and I spotted tons of black mold.

My personal preference are the Oasis Guitar Humidifiers which come in regular (OH-1), guitar case (OH-6), and dry climate (Plus+) versions.

All three Oasis humidifiers follow the same principle  the tube holds crystals that absorb water and release the moisture slowly into the air humidifying the guitar. The tube is filled with water, preferably distilled, using a syringe.

Dry everything off and place the humidifier in the sound hole or case, depending on the model.

Normally I re-fill the tube once a week but its easy if it needs more water, since the tube shrinks when empty.

I just found out you can order the crystals and replenish them annual from http://oasishumidifiers.com/.

The Oasis OH-6 Case Humidifier fits in your guitar case and has a magnetic strip in the tube and metal clip. Not every case has the place to put this.

If I am putting a guitar away for the winter, I use the Herco. If I will play the guitar frequently but keep it in a case, I use the Oasis OH-6.

Oasis also has special instrument humidifiers such as the Oasis Case Plus+ Humidifier, Oasis Mandolin Humidifier, Oasis Ukulele Humidifier, and OH-21 double bass humidifier. Since I haven't tried the OH-21 I cant tell you if it works or not. If you buy the OH-21 from Amazon.com and it does not work, you can return it.",5.0

"Perfect- incredible, and easy to tune. I have been drumming for 30 years. I had one of these when i was younger and dumber, and liked it then, but for stupid reasons let it go. Anyways, I've always liked Ludwig snare heads which this comes with, so left them on. I took it out of the box, seated the head, put a full turn past finger tight on the bottom with about an extra 1/4 on the 4 lugs by the snare bed. I then put  full turn (maybe just slightly less) on the top and it sounds PERFECT!!!! Deep, throaty, tight, with slight ring, no crappy over tones or buzzes. Adjusted the snares as loose as i could before getting fuzzy. It sound so good i can't believe it......",5.0
Just works well.,5.0
"I got this for my son to play with his guitars.  It has the ability to play in auditorium at his school but not so big as to take up all the space in his room.  The clear precise sound from this amp is excellent.  Even though it has two input jacks for two instruments, you cannot play two at the same time.  You can find a lot of amps at pawn shops and music stores that often can be overpriced and of questionable sound.  Fender is a well known product and they know how to make them right.  For the price you can't go wrong.",4.0
great learning tool for granddaughters!,5.0
"This is fantastic and works as expected.  I did one modification (being paranoid), once it was extended and set up, I wrapped black duct tape around the tightened extension grip.  Why?  Because if the extension fails, everything could suddenly drop.  So if you extend it up and intend to leave it in one place, I suggest duct taping the extension lever in its tightened position.

There are no bad effects of this stand on my guitars.  They sit nicely on it, mostly supported by the neck, but the legs offer the base of your guitar something to lean on as well, meaning its not as much tension as a normal neck-support stand.  And that's probably good.",4.0

"I was looking to add another keyboard to my lineup and saw this was on sale at Guitar Center.  For the price, it's a decent machine, though I was disappointed with its capabilities in creating original compositions.  I have higher-end equipment (a Yamaha MOXF88) so I'm fairly well-versed on what a capable workstation can do.  The WK-6600 has a nice assortment of voices for a $300 machine.  The tone editor has some interesting features for creating custom sounds.  Unfortunately, when it comes to making custom patterns and sequences, this machine is not a good choice.  It seems you are mostly limited to their preset rhythms, and can only modify small elements of each provided track.  Two other production workstations I own allow me to make original compositions (drum, bass, accompaniments, etc.) from scratch.

The keys are not weighted, but do have a sturdy and responsive feel to them.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the onboard speakers. They are plenty loud with rich-sounding output.  The WK-6600 is only recommended for beginners who want something functional to learn the basics.  If you're a more advanced musician, especially one who creates original compositions, you'll want to stay away from this.  The user manual was not very helpful in allowing me to understand how to put tracks together.  While their song recorder feature might allow you to create your own music, it was a difficult process compared to other workstations.  Plus, the apparent lack of a pattern sequencer which allows for unfettered creation was a big deal-breaker for me.  It's going back to Guitar Center for a refund.",3.0
"This case is extremely well made for the budget. I am very impressed with its durability and craftsmanship. I owned a Bellafina double violin case previously which endured for almost 10 years.

The storage compartment has ample space and I can easily store my tuner, extra set of strings, capo, and guitar strap with room to spare. The only reason this case doesn't get 5 stars is because of the latches and lock. The case has 4 latches which seem a little light, but I don't see any issue with them accidentally  coming open with normal use, i just wouldn't expect them to stay closed if the case get tossed around like a rag doll. My biggest issue which is the reason for deducting a star is because of the locking mechanism. One of the latches locks but feels incredibly flimsy and I'm sure any key shaped object or paper clip could unlock it easily. But if you're looking for a nice inexpensive case you protect your guitar from normal life then this case is great.",4.0
"I was a little surprised and how industrial this case was when it arrived. Then, I put my mandolin in the case and it fit perfectly. The case was larger than I expected.

Over all I'm pleased with the product. It seemed a little expensive, but you get what you pay for. I would have been disappointed in just a gig bag quality

The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the weight of the case.",4.0

"This was my first ocarina. I bought it for several reasons, the main one being that it is plastic and hardy, able to hold up to any abuse it might receive in my amateur care. I've had it for a few days now, and I absolutely love it. It has a rich, beautiful sound to it that I did not expect from something made of plastic, despite all the reviews saying it sounds like a clay ocarina.
It comes with a song booklet showing the fingering required for each song, so you don't have to learn to read notes just to play the songs included. The instructions on fingering are a little vague, but once you figure it out it is very easy to play. I have pretty small fingers, but this would work for someone with larger hands as well, although the thumb holes are a little too big for anyone with fingers thinner than mine. The ocarina comes with a sturdy cord of matching color already tied securely to it, through the little hole you can see in the picture by the mouthpiece.
It is quite a bit heavier than it looks, and feels very solid, even more solid than I'd expected it to be. This is not a toy at all, but a real instrument in every way.
My only complaint about it being plastic is that every so often, especially in humid weather, I have to clean the moisture buildup out of it. That's pretty simple though, I just take a piece of paper and fold it over a few times, then slide it in and out of the mouthpiece a few times. This is the only reason I rate it at four stars instead of five.
It shipped out far quicker than I expected. Amazon usually tells you when an item ships, but for some reason didn't on this order. I received it on a Saturday of all days, and in the evening! It came in a nice little box with the seller's logo on it, and I've kept the box to store both the booklets and the ocarina inside.
This ocarina has gotten me hooked on these beautiful little instruments, and I will definitely be buying from Songbird Ocarinas again.",4.0

Also, the microphone is supposed to have a built in ""shock mount"" - that's baloney.  Sitting at my desk, I can't even think about moving without it picking it up and it being obvious in the audio.

"Bought this as my first tube amp. Had done a lot of research and finally decided to pull the trigger. Man I'm glad I did. Right out of the box it sounded stunning. And the infinium tech in the amp really does extend the life of the tubes. I eventually had to swap out the stock tubes because they are only good for maybe 3 months. Switched to JJ's and haven't had to change tubes in in almost three years and I play every Sunday at church plus the occasional gig or two throughout the week. I wasn't sure about Bugera since I never heard of them especially being the price was way cheaper than the big name amps. But I will put this thing up against any of them and can be assured my tone will sound just as great if not better than the others. What a deal on this amp!

"I run bass through a split chain. The first signal runs through a big muff and into a bass amp. The other starts with a bass synth into the regurgitator into an octave up, distortion, and delay into a separate amp. The more effects I have on, the cooler this thing is. I keep the knob cranked for maximum insanity.

I'm...not entirely certain how to describe it, but it works to help create a ""wall of noise"" that adds some texture to my solo (with drum loops) and band (bass and drums) practices. Haven't played out with it yet.

I've only messed around with this thing for a few hours, and I haven't tried to use it subtly. So far, I love it. Even if you aren't looking for the fascinating sound manipulation this thing is capable of, it also functions as an effects loop if you turn the knob all the way in the other direction.

It won't be for everyone, but if you like experimenting with sounds...you can't really go wrong at well under $100.",5.0

"I played on an acoustic upright all my life and last year donated it and purchased the YPG-235 as my first keyboard. It served me well, but travelling was difficult being under 5 ft. I needed something basic, but high quality for open mics and teaching. This was it. The keys have resistance similar to the YPG-235, no its not hammer action (add 25 lbs for that folks) but its enough for someone who is use to pianos to play comfortably.  The sounds are exactly enough variation to play gigs, though a guitar/flute sound would have been a bonus. The built in demos songs are all familiar favorites from bach, mozart, beethoven, schumann and even a rag time scott joplin! It has reverb, dual sound, metronome.

"So basically i give 5 stars for the audiobox, and 3 for the compatibility of the software with windows 7.

The audiobox itself is an excellent device for recording. Presonus always has great amps and they've included them in the audiobox and in my mind blows out other small preamp/audio interface devices. More than adequate for any amateur artist.

I originally had my audiobox software and associated studio one artist software installed on my old laptop running windows xp and I have no problems whatsoever with it. But when i bought a new laptop with windows 7, i spent hours of frustration trying to sync the audiobox with my computer, and figure out how to install the correct drivers for studio one. The presonus website is fairly unhelpful, but after intense searching i found the latest installer for studio one in the My Account page at the presonus site and was finally able to get all my programs running correctly.

I really don't know what presonus is doing with this software compatibility issue. They have a great audio recording device here combined with the most frustrating, outdated software. So if you're a windows 7, 64 bit user just be prepared that you might have some initial problems installing the software and syncing your devices. Great product otherwise.",4.0
"As another review stated, this is a more modern sounding fuzz.  It's not as wooly and splattery as a vintage fuzz.  It's not as over-the-top as an EH Big Muff.  This pedal can walk the line between distortion and Fuzz depending on how you EQ it.  I've read online that this is a clone of the Frantone Peach Fuzz, however I don't own one of those and from what I understand, she's not making pedals anymore.  Whatever it is, I like it.  I find that all fuzz pedals sound much better running into a fairly clean amp.  It sounds great going into either my Fender Champ or my Palomino V32 when it's running clean.  All of the Cool Cat pedals have true bypass and sturdy metal cases.  The knob/jack placement is somewhat inconvenient but you get over it pretty quickly.  Once I'm dialed in, I don't do a lot of tweeking.  I think this represents a superb value given what they are sellng for.  Five stars based upon price/value ratio.  Rock on.",5.0

"There's been a flood of Chinese guitar effect pedals to the market in the past 5-10 years, and while some of these are substandard knock-offs of popular (usually vintage) effects circuits, there's been quite a few brands that offer surprising quality and popular circuits shrunk down to a mini-sized pedal (and offered at incredibly low prices).  Many of these Chinese brands tend to run in the same ""family"" - you'll notice Mooer pedals repackaged as cheaper Donner pedals, and so on.  I kept coming across the brands called ""Aroma"" and ""Tomsline"", but for the most part, I passed on those because they did not see very durable to me.

Recently, however, I noticed this A & A brand (which is still labeled Aroma in many of the purchase links).  This particular Germanium Fuzz pedal became available on Amazon in June 2016.  This seems to be an exact remarketing of the Tomsline pedal line, albeit with a more solid enclosure, and about another 20-33% cheaper, at least here in the U.S.  And, I have to say, I'm generally quite impressed with the build quality of this lineup.  If you're familiar with the Donner pedals, I'd say these are nearly identical.  The I/O jacks are firmly attached to the casing, and so is the 9V jack.  The pot for the Fuzz knob isn't the firmest turn in the world, but should work fine for the immediate future.

So, the A & A Germanium Fuzz appears to be a clone of a clone of a clone.  It's a re-housed version of the G-Fuzz sold by the Tomsline/Aroma brands, which itself was (probably) derived from the circuit of the Mooer Grey Faze.  And all of these pedals are based off the germanium transistor red Fuzz Face pedal, which was popularized in the 1960's, and by Jimi Hendrix in particular.

I am not a fuzz expert.  But, recently, I've started to experiment with some of these Chinese fuzzes because: (1) I have an interest in experimenting with fuzz pedals, but not to the tune of $150 a pedal; (2) There are some classic fuzz circuits that are extremely simple from an electronics standpoint, and should be relatively easy to clone with some accuracy; and (3) A lot of the original fuzz box designs (like the Fuzz Face and Big Muff) were sold in massive or oddly shaped cases that were impractical to use, and mini pedals are extremely compact and convenient.

So, I am not the most qualified person to say how this sounds compared to a Dunlop Fuzz Face.  But having a used a variety of original design and cloned fuzzes, I thought the Germanium Fuzz sounded pretty good!  Or, at the very least, it exhibits most the key characteristics germanium fuzz circuits are celebrated for - namely warm, rounded tones and an uncanny ability to clean up by backing off the guitar volume.  The Germanium Fuzz, like the Fuzz Face, does not have a tone knob, but it's not knob would do much with this type of gain anyway.  It has plenty of low end, and seemed to work better with my single coil pickups versus higher-output humbuckers.  It definitely has the potential to become overly muddy, but as with many fuzzes, this is very dependent on the settings of your amp.  Germanium fuzzes really want to push dirty tube amps - you can use them over a clean amp with the volume on ""2"", but it's usually not the optimal use of the effect.

Based on this experience, I'm definitely interested in checking out other A & A pedals.  The Germanium Fuzz was a good first choice because it was type of gain pedal that I didn't have, and for as sparingly as I'm likely to use it, it feels better spending around $25 on it versus $100.

UPDATE (03/19/17) - Another reviewer gave a lower rating for this pedal, noting a significant drop in volume when he used the pedal.  I disagree with the rating, and stand by my 5-star review, but there is some merit to his point about the volume drop, and it should not have been omitted from my review.  Many fuzz pedals (as well as many high gain distortions) suffer from a degree of volume loss because the sound wave can become so clipped or compressed that the signal going in is going to sound ""quieter"" coming out unless you compensate for that.  With the AGF-5 Germanium Fuzz, there is a volume drop, but I still felt it was very close to unity gain with the Level knob turned up.  Moreover, while I'm not an expert in using vintage Fuzz Faces (the pedal this one is cloning), my understanding is that those were not particularly high-output pedals, either.  So, in a sense, it's very true to the original Fuzz Face circuit - warts and all.",5.0

"This is supposed to match the DGX 630/620 and YPG 635/625 series digital pianos/keyboards.  Even though Yamaha ""makes"" it (they list the WB2 on their site, but probably outsource it), the colors on this are way off from the piano, and do not match the picture.  In fact the legs of the bench are actually a different color than the top portion that supports the padding.  The legs have a very distinct orange tint that clashes with the top and with the piano, even when viewed from a distance.  The top portion is much closer to the correct color, but the manufacturer must have decided to use a cheaper material for the legs.  Also, the seat cushion material is not a tan color, as the picture indicates, but instead has a greenish tint to it.  I swear I'm not color blind!  My wife took one look and thought it was hideous and I'm now returning it.  I don't normally do many product reviews, but I really think it's a crime that this says it is a matching bench.

"Before I ordered the Shorty bass a couple of  years  ago, I didn't know what to expect.  Wanted a ""small"" and ""travely"" guitar.  After the Christmas rush, I finally got it.  At five lbs.,  it is not a Rickenbacker in size and weight.  But it's probably the coolest bass guitar I've bought( being short-scale helps).  And if you're into simplicity,  you can't beat it.  A solid, maybe not spectacular, bridge and bridge saddles.  A single soapbar humbucking pickup blends in really nice.  And a tone control coupled w/ a volume control that are sturdy, smooth, and hard to strip.  The A, D, & G strings oddly enough sound like if they were on much bigger bodied bass guitar.  The E string, though, has that Hofner rubbery sound.  Thought I would hate it at first, but have come to love it.  And then the machine heads.  They are decent(even though modding them out is a possibility, along with the pickup).  I will say this, the tuning keys that come w/ the guitar are small enough to where it's easier to keep the guitar in tune.  The thing I like about these types of single pickup bass guitars is that they let you move around in the pocket, without worrying about to many pickups to deal with(just personal preference).  If you're on a budget, picking out bass guitars to add to your arsenal,  this could be in there maybe as a back-up guitar.  The only reason I didn' t give it 5-stars is that the neck is a tad bulky, but that is something you can get used to.",4.0

"Originally I hoped that this WCP-60V would be useful with an F-hole resonator guitar (it was not) but I also wanted to try it for acoustic guitar.

I bought both this WCP-60V and the WCP-60G. The 60G clips on easier and has much stronger output. However, after trying many different placement options, I ended up choosing this 60V for two different types of acoustic guitars.

For the 60V pickup, you probably want to use a compressor (I use the Mooer Yellow Comp) or cab-emulation pedal to get better sound and bring it to life. Multiband EQ is also a good additional option.

Comparing the 60G and 60V, the 60G was louder, fuller and had more bass. However, even the best 60G positioning did not really sound very natural or balanced. The 60V was better for that.

While guitar picking worked for both pickups, strumming tended to sound unnatural and distorted. I could not find any position where strumming sounded good.

BTW, I found that the most natural sound when using the WCP-60V with my Seagull Excursion Natural Folk SG acoustic guitar was obtained by placing the pickup near the far back of the bottom of the soundhole and then hooking the curved clip firmly over the inner soundhole brace so that the pickup was very flat and locked in place as much as possible. The pickup was angled backward at about 60 degrees from the bottom string.",4.0

"I bought this guitar for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas so she could have her own instrument to learn to play her favorite Taylor Swift songs.  I have been playing bass guitar for over 20 years and had a few full size guitars lying around that were just a little too big for her to handle.

Out of the package, the guitar seemed OK, but one of the strings was bent / kinked right between the hole and the bridge.
I bought new D'Addario light strings and started setting up the guitar...I was extemely dismayed that I had a real hard time keeping the guitar in tune for more than a few strums.
I was even more dismayed to find out that I had the top 2 strings (E & A) tuned by hitting the E-5th fret and open A simultaneously, but was way out of tune (~1/4 to 1/2 step) when I played the E octave on the A string (7th fret).  I had the same problem on all strings.

Bottom line - this would be fine if you just need an instrument for decoration, but I would not suggest as a learning guitar.
Why would you subject your child to the frustration of learning to play on an instrument that does not play or stay in tune?
They will have enough of a challenge learning the basics, building their skills, and staying motivated and focused long enough to make progress.

"Disappointed as I thought this would attach easily, however I was unable to attach correctly for it to depress strings even after watching videos. It would not align correctly and it appeared to not lay with the actual true finger formation of note and chord playing. This may be a misunderstanding on my part, as I did not have much luck with it. Other than that it arrived as promised and packaged well.",3.0
"I got this 2 years ago.  It's an excellent piece of hardware, supported by excellent software.  My setup is an MXL990 mic, a Dell Vostro Core2 running Vista with 2GB of RAM.  I use Sonar Home XL for recording, although I've also used Audacity.  If you need to get high quality sound into your computer, the TonePort is the best inexpensive way to get it.  High quality sound, lots of options and digital effects with the included free software.  Really versatile for a home studio.

Since I got this, I started an a capella quintet, so I need more places to plug in mics and I'll be upgrading sometime soon.  For now, this works great.  My brother has used his to record professional-sounding recordings.  Good stuff.",5.0
"Love it! Not everyone can afford high end DJ controllers. The controllers have appealing features, but in the end, it's the sound that matters. This product takes a flat sound and enriches it, without needing a large space in the DJ rig. Good low end punch up, and music clarity!",5.0
"If you are absolutely new to recording, and want something small and convenient to so you can scrap together a demo, the Audiobox USB will work great. If you want an interface that will continue being useful after about a year, look elsewhere.

To be honest, this should be great product for the price, but there is one serious issue that makes it unuseable. What makes me uneasy about recommending this product to anyone is that it has an absolutely abysmal noise floor. I could not get my mic signals anywhere near audible before I was assaulted by a sheet of buzzing and humming. Like I said, if you are just trying to record a demo to send out to venues or show friends, this thing will do the job, but as soon as you want to record something presentable, you're going to have to upgrade.

One final gripe is that as someone with somewhat big hands, this thing was a nightmare to control. The knobs are situated in a way that makes it easy to bump and knock something out of the desired setting. It didn't matter much aside from the input controls but it was still annoying.

Long story short: If you just want something simple for bedroom recordings, this is fine. If you're planning on recording anything to release, spend a little more for a less noisy interface.",2.0
"The case seems to be made well. I find that the wedges for the peg head are too thick. I don't see their need as the banjo fits tightly and is secure without them.  The case is about two inches shorter than a TKL and while my banjo fits in it, there is only about 1/4 inch or less between the tip of the peg head and the case wall.  Because of the tight fit between the banjo and the velour/foam I am unable to close the case with the shoulder strap still attached.  This is truly inconvenient.",3.0
"The Ocarina was cool, it even came on its package (wich showed there are actually like 3 other colors) It seemed well carved and all, it was playable and easy to get used to.
The downside is that this had weird markings on the lower holes that made it look cheap besides that line in the corner that easily gives away the fact that this were too pieces pasted together, altough you play nice first it can't go to really high notes, it gets to a silent blow and then a screech so...

If you want to have it for exhibition it will look OK

Yet if you want it as an instrument to play, you should spend a little more on a porcelain ocarina, or a marble ocarina if you are really serious about this.

This is just plastic, even though it's good for practice so, you can use this for practice and play for reals on a higher quality ocarina.

"This Jew's Harp by Glazyrin is one of the best I have ever played in 4 decades of love affairs with this quirky instrument.
The stainless steel manufacturing is superb quality - tolerances between the tang and two arms are so tight I thought it would be a problem - in fact, you realise how tight when you tilt the instrument only a few degrees downwards and get that tell-tale metal-on-metal vibrating.  Held in correct position, its a dream to play.  Having the central tang mounted using two high quality stainless steel Torx screws just tells me its top quality.
Even the end of the tang, an area where cheaper harps just leave it unfinished and prone to catch on clothing or get bent - Glazer's design is stunning - the tang end protrudes only 2cm out at a perfect 90 degrees and is finished in a tight ball - I'm already planning a little cedar carry case for it (although these are also available).
Ergonomically, having a very long section to hold works for me - especially in longer drawn-out playing.
With any musical instrument, beautiful design always make a difference - this looks elegant and sitting on my desk right now, keeps distracting my eye!
Sound-wise: beautifully rich tones and a volume level that just surprised me completely!  Its a very user-friendly feeling and invites a strong playing style.  Its a winner!

"Love this pedal. If I want Crosby & Nash backing me up - I got it. If I want Carole King on the chorus - I got it. Art Garfunkle harmonizing with me - I got it. Everly Brathers that too. Very cool to add realistic backup singers when you are a solo performer/ Voicing on the tone section ( mostly compression) does add to the sound and it has a good continuously adjustable reverb. Easy to connect. The trick to use is learning when to leave out some picking runs you might normally add (I'm a fingerstye player) and just hit a solid chord during the vocals. Can always toss the picking in on an instrumental. Sometime it works well to keep the run as the harmony will follow the instrument - you can play off it and get harmony shifts while you hold a fundamental. Depends on the application - have to work with it to figure what works and what doesn't. I'm having lots of fun with it. I was concerned that I would not like it as much as I do when paying the price, but I think it's well worth it for the right players. Also strikes me as a high quality - well made product.",5.0

"It's OK for a young student.

The neck on ours cracked.  It was easily repaired with some glue (as have half the school orchestra instruments).

I bought the 600 for my middle school daughter because I figured we could buy this for about what we'd pay in rental fees in a year or two (>$45 a month).  The instrument is very pretty and sounds decent (Remember, middle school kids play songs like Twinkle, twinkle little star and Jingle Bells).

I figure a nicer set of strings will help it sound nicer, but compared to some of the school instruments and rentals out there, ours is a lot nicer (and I will probably be able to resale ours in a couple years and recoup most of my money).  So, if you have a young student and don't want to rent, the 600 would be a fine choice (you can always upgrade your strings and bow to make it sound nicer).",4.0

"Okay so I've had a week to thoroughly look over the violin, bow, case, and included accessories.

Pros:

* it's a playable, tune-able violin for  under $80.
* comes with all the necessities to play violin.
* though factory made, the violin itself is quite sturdy.
* sounds clear (a bit more crisp then mellow) once tuned.
* sound post was fine on delivery and hasn't budged.
* the included spare set of strings come in handy, and make initial tuning less stressful.
* carrying case is nice, strong enough to take a (light) tumble, and should protect the violin from the weather at least.  soft interior.
* bridges are acceptably shaped, and work well if used with care. (still, might consider getting one with adjustable feet)
* fine tuners feel a bit delicate, but work well.

Cons:

* violin is definitely NOT varnish/gloss as it is described as and appears in the pictures, but rather a (quite surprisingly) glittery gloss.
* the bow is warped pretty bad, I'd say it's about an inch further to the right from frog to tip.  that being said, it's still usable.
* the ""quality rosin cake"" came pre-broken, and was in several pieces. (though after reading a few reviews, that should be expected)
* shoulder rest is pretty rough, and the pad is verging on inadequate.

Conclusion:

This is an excessively affordable, playable, accessory ridden bargain of a violin.  Don't set your expectations too high; remember you're not buying some Stradivari gem.  Absolutely do purchase a spare bow, shoulder rest, rosin, and nicer quality strings to use after getting the feel for tuning using the provided sets.  You really don't have to take it to some luthier for tuning (unless the sound post has fallen), just take your time and remember you've got another set or two to get it just right.  For the price, this is a good deal.  It'll take a bit of patience to get it all set-up and (likely) maintain, but all in all I'm quite pleased with my purchase.

If your looking for a bargain, it's nice; get it, and buy a bunch of spare stuff for funsies.  Handle with care.",4.0

"Outstanding microphone, great sound with very cool look.  I bought this mic a couple years back to record a podcast - strictly voice.  Our podcast turned into a short radio program on a couple of stations, and the mic has been everything we need.  I'm not a techie, so I can't speak to anything detailed about it.  I can say that we brought the mic to the radio studio that was broadcasting us, and the DJ was very impressed.  Sound recording and editing is his business, and he was surprised by the quality that we got from the G Track.  He helped us with the editing software to set all the right levels on the equalizer, and after that it was ready for radio.  A hundred bucks for a mic, and the right settings on the recording software, and we nearly matched the sound level in there multi-thousand dollar studio.

If you want to check out the sound quality for yourself, go to our podcast on throughtheword.org - compare the Daniel series (recorded in the radio station studio on their equipment) to the Luke series (recorded on the G Track at home).  There is a difference, but not too much.  Both were broadcast on the radio.  I should mention that it helps A LOT to have a DJ teach you how to set all your levels and edit properly.

Plus the mic looks supercool.  Seriously, I get comments on it all the time.  We occasionally set up a table at conferences, and I set the mic out on the table just for looks.  People literally stop by just to ask about the microphone.  Overall - highly recommend!",5.0

"Edit: This review is from a viewpoint of someone who haven't used the previous M50 version. This review is generally about the overall quality of this headphone!
My Review:
This is one of the best headphone I've owned. Even more expensive headphones like the Sennheiser HD series (besides the HD800 I guess) are not as good as this one. There are several factors that make this headphone awesome:

Comfort: 10/10
First of all, I want to talk about the component that separates this headphone from the Sennheiser HD series or other headphones; the comfortable of this headphone is unmatchable by other brand headphones. I have big ears and the ear cups fit perfectly inside my ears as well as the tightness of the ear cups doesn't hurt my ears either which helps with extended listening/wearing. The earcups are made out of some sort of soft leatherish rubber which is once again...super soft and comfortable. Same thing for the headband, it's so soft and fit to my head so well. They also put some sort of soft cushion under the earpads for extra comfort. Which are all pretty neat and cool features.

Sound Quality 30/30:
+Highs 10/10: Perfect, crisp
+Mids 10/10: Really clear and balance
+Lows 10/10: Very good base and smooth.
I'm not an expert or audiophile but dang this headphone sounds good. Everything sounds differently, every song sounds like a new song and you can hear everything in the audio file as long as you have the good enough quality audio track. I've listen with this headphone from all kinds of music: classic, rock, pop, alternative, etc. Everything just sound so good. In my own opinion, I think that this headphone sounds better than the Sennheiser HD598 HD280 380 because of the improved base as well as the clearer background I guess (just my own opinion). Also in my own opinion, I think this headphone is better than the Bose QC15 and is comparable to the Shure SHR1440. Overall, everything sounds smooth crisp with incredible base. Get this for your own to try it out and you'll see what I mean.
(I will update more as I break it in a little bit more, could be even better :D)

Looks 9.99/10:
It looks great and well... This is again a personal reference/opinion. This headphone is very fashionable and awesome looking. It's also very light so you can wear it outside no problem!
This is just my opinion on the look but you can look at the picture and judge for yourself. :D

Feels 10/10:
Very solid and durable. Inside is made out of metals/aluminum (I'm not really sure). You can feel the quality of it from top to bottom , it feels very dense and solid (unlike the plasticky feel from say the QC15 or HD380)...From the ear cups to the leather padding. It's a great built headphone overall. The cables are also thick and durable (I like the coil one because I tend to move around a lot).
Overall, great upgrade from the last model (which I never own one, I took this sentence from reading other reviews :D)

Pricing 10(+5) or 15/10:
For a headphone like this,I could pay 400 dollars for it and still feel worth it. I don't know, may be it's just me but I feel like getting this headphone for just around 200 dollars (plus tax) from Amazon is way too cheap. With this awesome quality built, comfort level as well as supreme sound, this headphone is way too good for its price/competitor.
[Hurry, get this now before Audio Technica raise the price:) ...jkjk haha]

Conclusion:
That's all I have for now. I hope you find my review helpful and help you somewhat make up your mind to purchase a great headphone. If anyone would ask me which headphone to buy within the 500 dollars range, I would tell them to save the other 300 and get this headphone in a heartbeat!

Some extra comparison:
-ATH-M50x or Beats Pro HD $500 => Beats: Broncos ATH-M50x: Seahawks (lol sorry Broncos fans)
-This heaphone or QC15: This headphone for sound quality and price. QC15 for sound cancellation. About the same comfort level.

P/S: Sorry for any grammatical errors or mistakes. Please feel free to leave any comments, improvements that I could make for my reviews as well as some more comparisons that I could do. Thanks again for reading my review!",5.0
"The price was right, and I'm the only one I know that has chrome stand! It's been good to me gigging out live every few weeks. I did put a sleeve over it though during travel to try and prevent it from scratching! It's just as steady as all of my other round base stands. And I actually like the adjust better than the one that's on my black one, but that could just be because it's a newer version?",5.0

"Parts are labelled alphabetically. Instead of parts G and H, I received two units of Part H. This made the desk impossible to build without drilling additional holes to make it all fit together. I don't know how well this MacGyvering will hold up over time.

Not a bad desk, otherwise - but this major screw-up made it very frustrating to put together.",2.0

"Audio quality is pretty good for such a small wireless device. I use this to hide listening to music at work. It does the trick and fits in my ear perfectly with the large included tip. You get 3 different sizes to fit your ear and get the right fit. Once its snug in my ear it never falls out while i'm walking around or jogging. Connecting was simple enough and very similar to other bluetooth devices.

THE RANGE IS EXCEPTIONAL I was in the room across from mine about 30ft from my iphone no loss in quality and no cutting out. impressive.",5.0
"I don't know if it would be my 1st choice for my 14lb Les Paul recording bass, but it is perfect for my 5.5 lb Rob Allen Mouse. Also very cool (I live in Hawaii)...but a bit scratchy to wear with a tank top.",5.0
thanks very good,5.0
"This is a very nice strap but I don't think it is leather. I have tried to use the strap but the odor is just too much and I have decided to return it. I left it outside to air out for 3 days and it still stinks, bad. I have inspected the strap closely and I can honestly say I don't believe there is any leather on it. The strap is constructed well and sewn nicely and I would keep it except 1) it is slick and does not stay in one place on your shoulder and 2) it smells.  I've decided to spend the extra 20 bucks and get a real leather Gibson strap",3.0

I haven't experienced any of the negative problems offered in other reviews.  My case is well made and has functioned very well for me.  I plan to purchase another.  When in use I remove the top so no problems with the hinges.  I would recommend it.,5.0

Just ordered this brand cable and it works great and as expected and it meets my needs.  The ETA and delivery was on time and easy to order online through Amazon.  I would order it again (if and when I next need such a cable).  I would recommend GLS cables to anyone looking for a really good quality cable at the best price.,5.0
"I got this item as a gift for my roommate. She is a great singer and she just wanted a simple mic and speaker karaoke machine for fun.  We had another really cheap one before that worked fine (American Idol branded) so neither of us were expecting much from a $50.00 machine, but it still disappointed us.  The speaker was pathetic, we fully expected it to be bad, and just hook it up to the television, but it was just weak and distorted.  When we hooked up to the television we discovered it had a major delay that made it unusable.  I have got to say this might of been my worst Amazon purchase.  With such good reviews, I really though it was the best of the cheaper ones....I was WRONG!",1.0

"I have been buying these strings for years for a Jazz Bass and have never been happier.  The coating is great, looks awesome but doesn't have that coated feel.  They are also very durable, I was regularly going through strings using ""slap and pop"" techniques and these hold up much better.  For my other basses I use the black ones to match better.  I'll never buy a different brand of strings again.",5.0
"This is a great all around rig. Light enough for a practice amp, big enough as a backline rig. Power is good for up to medium sized rooms. Want more power and low end -- add the PF-115LF cab and get 450 out of it. I absolutely love this amp.  Best of all, you get all the tone you can stand, and then some. Unless you need something for a stadium, you can ditch your other rigs and just play this! I play my Musicman Stingray HH5 thru this and I wouldn't have anything else. Buy this amp!",5.0

"I was looking between the Apogee Jam, the Line 6 Sonic, and this.  What sold me on the iRig is the fact that Amplitube lets you play a song directly from your iTunes library AND allows you to control the volume of the song independently from the guitar volume.  The other programs didn't seem to have this functionality.

This works with GarageBand as well and I go back and forth between Amplitube and GarageBand.  Amplitube seems more full-featured but the free version nickel and dimes you to death with in-app purchases.  I'll probably buy the paid verson and hope it includes more pedals, recording options, etc.

This piece of hardware is incredible and uses your iPad battery.  There is a new product from IK called the PowerBridge which allows you to charge at the same time as well.",5.0
"Nice headset, it is clear and picks up sound well, the flexible arm makes it easy for me to move it away from my head if I have to sneeze or cough! lol I like this headset and it is my go to head mic now.",5.0

"I ordered this product based on reviews I read on Amazon.  It arrived in just 3 days, in perfect shape.  The product actually exceeds my expectations (the picture looks brown, I was actually wanting a black case...and that's what this one turned out to be).  Very sturdy and appears to be well made.  Highly recommended.",5.0
Works great!,5.0
Very good project! Happy with purchase. Only downfall is with the mixer it can become very heavy pretty quickly.,5.0
Came quickly and works well-great price.  I would reorder another one and use it often.  Certainly recommended for any playing guitar,5.0
"Junk, untuned, flimsy, you can probably find it at a dOlla store for a buck.",1.0
"This light is a perfect and affordable solution for a good wall wash/uplighting. The colors are brilliant (plenty of brightness to light the details on the wall) but also can be dimmed for more subltle lighting. The on board programs are diverse and I love the 3 section lighting feature, and the speed, fade and flash features are full spectrum so you can really change things up a lot. The RGB dimmers let you create your own colors which is helpful because the pre-programmed color bank, while decent, does seem to over emphasize blues and reds and there really aren't many purples/yellows included. It does cover a good 4 foot section of the wall even though the bar is about 2 feet wide.

IMPORTANT:
If you want to operate this as a single light unit make sure you order the ADJ Radio frequency remote (also available on amazon) as it is NOT included with this light. This light does work well with the remote: you can use the blackout button to turn the lights on/off, run the autorun program, access the color bank and all of the programs and control the RGB dimmers, and access all the speed/flash functions.",5.0
This was a gift for a music therapist.  She loves it!  Especially the key chain pick holder.  She will never be without a pick again plus she can make picks for her music therapist friends!,5.0
"These mics are a bargain! Not only do you get the 3 great mic's which are better-than-you-could expect quality, you get the mic clips, and a very useful carrying case as well.

I use these for recording live music, comedy etc - using a portable mixer, I use this to add to the mix. (My main mics are Shure SM58s and a few Diaphram mics, which are less suited to a live amplified environment).

It's $30. It's a bargain. If you want some good sounding mics for a steal of a price, try these.

They're pretty well built, but obviously not as sturdy as an SM58, but look at the cost. I'm still using them after a year, and they're still in one piece!",5.0
Exactly what we wanted. Received it within 3 days grom ordering.,5.0
Christmas gift for my boyfriend he loved it!!!,5.0
"I really like this light. I don't use it for a music stand. Instead, I ran the solar panel from the window to my indoor Ivy plant. I tucked the clip in the soil and strung the lights through the plant. It puts off a nice glow and a clean white light. The stems are fully adjustable and both lights hold their position well.

You can turn each on/off independently and light output from one stem is more than enough for reading.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you!

"I didn't use it the first couple of weeks that I was doing worship leadership at my church, but remembered to put it on my stand and found it invaluable. Always knew no matter what that I would never have to struggle in the middle of a worship service, trying to figure out where I put that pick. Will not lead without this. Got one for a friend too :)",5.0
"Bought this and a $5 Yamaha plastic recorder for our toddler to play with.

 Yamaha YRS-20BG 3 Piece Soprano Recorder 
The recorder is very study, almost unbreakable. It is well made sounds like a musical instrument and is easy to play. The fingering is slightly more challenging but it is in perfect tune.

5/5 stars.
Well-made.
Very durable.
Great tune.
Would buy again.

 Trophy 400 Flutophone 
The Flutophone is poorly constructed and made out of shoddy materials. It is very lightweight and feels extremely breakable. I do no think it can stand up to the abuse of a toddler using it so we're not letting our son play with it. Beyond the construction problems it just sounds awful. It is out of tune and sounds like a cheap plastic whistle from a box of Crackerjacks.

2/5 stars.
Poor construction.
Poor tuning.
Would not buy again.

"I was using an app on my cell phone and it would drain my battery if I left the app running.  This little bugger is all that you need.  The tuner works great even using the built in microphone.  I like to plug it into the 1/4"" jack though as it eliminates background sounds.  It will also generate a reference tone if you prefer.  I have found the microphone works equally well with unamplified solid body guitars  as well as it does with large acoustics.  I purchased it for the metronome  and it works just the way it should.  It's small an lightweight, smaller than a pack of smokes and 1/2 as thin.  It travels very well.  Check out the features, It's a very good buy at $19.

"These are amazing. I replaced the stock tuners on my Les Paul 100 with these and what a difference. They drop right in with no modification at all. They tune much more accurately (These have a 18:1 turn ratio where the stock tuners were only 14:1) and stay in tune 20x times better than the stock heads, which was the biggest thing for me. I find myself not only NOT having to re-tune between songs, but days after I've played, the strings are usually almost (if not perfectly) still in tune. Also, action of the Grovers is smooth as butter. The resistance on the tuning peg is adjustable with a Philips head screwdriver, but I really like the stock tension, so I left that alone. It's a small investment for a huge performance upgrade. Cannot recommend these enough! Not to mention they're shinny, and who doesn't like shinny things?",5.0

The G2 violin came in very good condition, it was already set up, tuned and ready to go. It came with a nice bow, a decent case with a moiture meter, plenty of room for a shoulder rest and a pocket for your music sheets, rosen and extra strings. My niece is very pleased with the sound of the G2, and with its looks. Its price is very reasonable. I am very pleased with the violin and Kennedy service, and would highly recommend them.",5.0

When I first received the Bronze Mantra I immediately looked to see if there were other products from this company, because it is difficult to purchase Singing Bowls unseen or heard.  They are a small company, but I have been very happy dealing with them, and look forward to hearing about more offering from them in the future.",5.0

"This little thing rules!

It won't run on batteries but who cares.

High quality build and dead quiet.

It's one of those pedals you'll probably leave on all the time because it makes your amp sound ballsier.

I use it mainly to put a little more hair on my 65 Princeton Reverb, at lower volumes, or turn it up a touch for a great Malcolm Young  sound.

It reacts much like a 57 Deluxe and has that elusive 'clean-distorted' sound if that makes sense.

It also adds a great mid boost that would look like a frown on a graphic eq.

"OK, at first I thought this was a bit gimmicky.  But I ordered the classic rock one anyway.  Then I noticed they were made by Korg.  I have a guitar turner made by Korg that I have had since the 80's.  So I all ready liked the company.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sounds you can get out of this.  It makes for a great alternative to the Rockman, and chews up less batteries.  :)

However, (this is why I only gave it 4 stars) this is clearly more designed to guitars that have your guitar cable jack on the face of the guitar (think fender) rather than on the edge of your guitar (think Gibson).  It makes the mini amp hard to operate and see when it is jacked into the underside edge of your guitar.  While Korg/VOX has tried to make it accessible from as many angles as they can (and did a good job with it too) it still is just a bit more cumbersome for the Gibson musician.

All in all, thanks Korg/VOX for a pretty nifty little guitar amp.",4.0

Occasionally, I will push the auto-repeat button, and the song will skip to a random position.  The buttons (nearly all of them  either register twice when I press them, or not at all.

"Purchased this to connect a midi keyboard to Garageband (2011 Macbook Pro). At first it didn't work at all, then I switched the midi in cable to the midi out on the keyboard and vise versa for the other cable.

"I should begin by mentioning that I am a bit of a cable snob.  My rig whether for recording or playing out is all mogami gold cables through and through.  Choosing to go with Mogami has been expensive, but at least I don't have to worry about my cables being an issue.  Recently I've decided to incorporate an effects loop into my live rig rather than just do the old fashioned guitar-pedals-amp approach.  The idea of shelling out $120 or so on 2 long enough Mogami cables turned me off to the idea, $120 would buy me a darn good pedal rather than some boring cables.

Fortunately I came across these.  I just bought the one to see how good they are, if it ended up being a big compromise from Mogami Golds I would just keep it as a living room guitar cable or give it away to someone who isn't a cable snob.  Turns out these are excellent cables and I'm buying another to make the loop.

I A/B'd this 20' cable with a Mogami Gold 18'.  The difference was very subtle, with the Planet Waves having a more poppy high end with slightly scooped mids and the Mogami's having a more flat and neutral EQ.  Again the difference wasn't much at all, but I would say on the whole that the Mogami's are more transparent.  For live guitar though, I actually would prefer the more excited high end from the Planet Waves so they really work for me.  I may not use them for recording as I don't like to have any sound coloration that I don't explicitly plan on having.

Regarding noise, both cables seemed equal here, which is to say that they do not pick up interference and add noise to your signal.  A definite must have feature for me.  The tip locking aspect of the planet waves also works very well.  I had bought a planet waves cable about 5 years ago that had a feature like this but instead it just ended up getting really stuck inside guitar jacks.  I'm glad they fixed this.  These cables also don't have a serious tendency of getting knotted up as they have a bit of a stiffness to them, although not too much so as to be too rigid and heavy.  I can't speak for long term use quality as I just got one, but they seem very well built.

Overall I would recommend these to anyone, whether they are a discerning pro with lots of funds or a starting musician on a budget. I especially would recommend these to a starting player since usually the cheap cables you buy to spend more on other stuff end up choking your sound to a significant degree.  Also these are made in America - that's why I was inclined to give them a shot even though they didn't say mogami on them.  Very glad I did.  If only they sold pedal patch cables like these, I might end up switching to Planet Waves entirely for live and keeping my expensive Mogamis for recording work only.",5.0

It took me a while to shop around on Amazon to find this gem but when I did and when it finaly arrived after a slight shipping error it ended up being worth more than what I paid.

I was also relieved to find that it kept its tune after an hour long blues jam session and sitting for 2 days (thus far)  I will continue to test out this product but I have no doubt that I will continue to love it!!!!!!!!,5.0

I got these because the reviews were good but man do they suck!  Seems like they got the Ohm's wrong or something.  Basically you can't hear the tweeters!

The Yamaha tweeters are crisp and clean and the Pyle's, well I can't hear them.  The Pyles frequency range is just the muddy mid range that bothers most people ears.  I thought maybe Outdoors they would fill better but it's just not the case.
I have probably 10 different sets of speakers (being I have a pro recording studio, home theater, car stereos) and these aren't even close to my worst other set of speakers. If they paralleled 1 or 2 more tweeters into the enclosure it may sound ok.

"I bought this mic to use for voice over work from my home. You can spend up to $5,000 for a pro mic, which I did not want to do. I did a lot of research on various USB condenser mics, and settled on this one, based on other reviews, cost, and simplicity. I was not disapointed. It is just as described...plug and play. The stand that comes with the mic stinks. It puts the mic off balance, and the smallest tap, will tip it over. If you are going to do it right, you need to buy a good short stand with a heavy base (about $25). You will also need a shock mount ($45), and a pop filter ($20). So when all is said and done, you really need close to $100 in extras to do it right. You can download Audacity (at [...]) for free. This is a great recording program, which allows you to record, edit, and add tracks...like background music. The only thing that I noticed is that I need to get really close to the mic to get the best sound, but that is not a big deal. If you need an inexpensive mic for voice recording, this is it!",5.0

"I bought this guitar a couple weeks after Christmas. Put along with it the ""one day shipping"" Took about a week to be delivered. So the shipping time was crap, seeing as i had one day shipping on it.

The playing was good. It stayed in tune quite nicely for me. The pick ups sounded good. all in all, great playing.

I had this guitar for about maybe 4 days before the guitar nut broke. making it unable to play, seeing as i couldn't find all the pieces to be glued back together. but even then, from all the vibration from the strings. It would've broke again.

Its was made in China, Its not USA made.

Its good for the price, seeing as its a hundred+ dollars. But its not well made, Before buying a guitar again, i will be sure to trust the reviews on it.

"I didn't realize when i read some of the reviews how big and heavy this piece is. Seems very sturdy. It uses a drum key to adjust and tighten the hinged sections. So you don't need extra tools. Both hinges have a sprocket so that once the sections are tightened, they lock in that position. What i feel are negatives are the lug screws that are used to tighten each hinge and secure where it attaches to the threaded cymbal stand are long so they stick out instead of snugging up against the shaft of the stacker. The other is that the bottom lug screw, when tightened, screws into the threaded portion of the cymbal stand which over time will flaten the threaded part on the stand. I cut a small piece of felt and put it in the hole so that the screw doesn't mar up the threads on the cymbal stand.",4.0

Now onto the short review: The windscreen has a very tight grip on it, and a loose end so the bars aren't effected by the screen.

"Fits my shoulder alright.
The wide pad helps keep the strain off of one point on your shoulder and spreads it out.

I do have a million usb cables and usb power adapters laying around, so I know I'll never be left trying to figure out how to get power to this thing if I lose the power cord. It doesn't have hammer action weighted keys, but the spring action still feels okay. Besides, the weighted keys would have added a lot of weight and cost to this keyboard, so it works great for what I use it for.

"The product is great. Costumers have complaints toward this is because this is not what they're looking for, but that's not the product's fault. Some people want many professional edits and many tracks, and records tons at once. Then they should save more money and buy an eight-track recorder that looks more multi-function. Some people suck at technology, then it's really your fault, because this thing is very easy to use. At first I thought it was a little bit complicated, but after going step by step with the user's manual, I found this tool very convenient. Top reason why this product is great is because this is very convenient. Also, this functions average expected abilities like listen to the previous recordings with recording a new track or set up different inputs. But this product needs a special plug found on [...] to power from adapter instead of batteries, which I don't have, so I'm using batteries right now. It needs four batteries at once to function, but the batteries surprisingly last very long. The recording quality isn't like the ones you hear on CDs or youtube where the sounds are so clear and professional, but it's fair with this price.

"I bought these in January of 2013. I was just having a convo with some other guitarists and mentioned that I was using these.

In my convo I had mentioned that I had them for only a few months, but then I came here to order more and it had the Jan 2013...Yes I know I neglected to change the strings, but they STILL sounded and played VERY well!!

I will say these are more ""Slinky"" than what I was used to and have installed my original string of 20+ years back on my guitar (it is a new set for all the smart asses out there) and they feel stiffer. I will be buying more Cobalts as I LOVE the sound and action I get out of my guitars with it!! I hope this short review helped!! :) Cheers!!",5.0

"I purchased this throne on Saturday, it arrived on Thursday, even though I used free ""Super Saver Shipping."" I don't have many hours on it yet, but upon first inspection and use, it is a very sturdy throne.  I'm 6'0"", 200lbs, and this thing stands up to my weight easily.  It looks great, I don't mind having this sitting in my family room where it can be seen.  One thing I want to mention, I adjusted the seat to the lowest possible setting and it was still 18"" high.  This will probably not be a problem for most drummers, but some guys like to sit low, and smaller kids might find it too high.

Pros:
1) Very sturdy/heavy duty.
2) Nice looking drum throne.
3) Comfortable seat with firm support and not too soft.
4) Super easy to set up, with a locking collar so you can easily set it to your favorite height every time.

Cons:
1) Seat does not spin. If you want this feature, you'll have to spend extra.
2) Lowest possible adjustment is 18"".  This should be fine for most drummers.

All in all I highly recommend this throne at the price!",5.0
"The Kaces 15-KB 88-Note Slim XPress Series Keyboard Bag seemed to be the best value that I found.  I've only had it a month but it has been satisfactory.  However, there are a few things that may be of interest to others.

The shoulder strap crosses the bag diagonally.  I imagine they did this to equalize the strain but in practice it just gets in the way when putting a keyboard in and out.  The simple solution is to just unclip it and don't use it -- the carrying handle is good enough for most transport, but a better design would have been nice. Sometimes I think engineers never use these things themselves.

Regarding the purchase -- I had to inquire whether the specifications were the inside or outside dimensions.  It would have been more convenient if the Amazon posting had mentioned it, since I wasn't thrilled about ordering it then finding out it was wrong.  After contacting them, they sent me to the manufacturer who sent me to their website which did answer the question (inside) -- this took an additional two days.",4.0

"Backstory:  I have a 1972 Martin D35 that was made before they put in adjustable truss rods. This one has an I-beam in the neck. And while it is pretty stable, there is a minimum amount of relief shift. The cold weather caused the relief to go a little higher than my arthritic hands liked and I was looking for a solution.  Someone suggested the DR Sunbeams because of the lower tension to to the construction of the strings. So I tried them.

These strings are exactly what my Martin D35 needed.  I had  been mainly playing various Martin strings and have been pretty happy.  But these DR's are all but are life changing.  While my D35 (1972) is one of the best guitars I've ever heard I always felt something was missing.  My Martin sounds a lot like a Taylor 814, but with a  Martin vibe. Very, very cool sounding. The strings add that bit of extra shimmer that was missing, without making things too bright.

It may be important to note that I put the DR's on my Taylor 614ce and it did not change the sound much, but is a lower tension than the Elixirs I had on it before.",5.0

"I use to 2 JBL/Jrx115.. I have used this amp in 20 gigs already. I use a Hercules Rmx/Steel midi controller with VDJ 7.0.  And I use a Pioneer ddj-t1 midi controller also. Keep in mind both of these have built  in sound cards. For some reason I clip  when Im using the pionner ddjt-t1 mixer.  But this was a block party I did and I  pushed it 8 hrs full potitional  with clipping  lights on and all mids,lows and highs all the way max. I needed to test it to see if it was quality or junk. I had warranty on it and some people won't do this, but Im a hardcore dj and I play loud and play hours and hours at a time.  The amp did not stop and did not overheat did not complain!!! And I used it over and over and over!!! As far the pioneer ddjt-1, I have not been using it lately for the reason of clipping. I don't know the specs but I think Traktor Pro 2 is a cleaner sound vs Vdj 7.0. I would recommend anyone if possible get the Qsc7 if possible. This amps pushes my speakers, but I feel like I need a little more juice. I know the Qsc7 is what I need. Performance is excellent for price.",4.0

My guitar was sounding a bit off / distorted for a couple of the strings.  I replaced it with new strings but the weird distortion was still present.  I suspected it was likely due to bridge saddle (obviously plastic) degrading.  I went browsing on AMZ and low behold found this and took a chance on it.  I had to really sand down the nut (see pic with the size difference) and for the bridge saddle it was not deep enough.  I had to compensate the bridge saddle height by placing a round toothpick in the slot and it did the trick.  The distortion was gone and the guitar did sound a noticeably better when the switch was done.,5.0

The synthentic Reed I ordered was the soft Reed & it's shape was an ideal oval. My son enjoys playing his Oboe more in beginning band & I appreciate not buying Reed's every few weeks. Definitely seems worth having even for an experienced player as the sound quality doesn't seem to be affected.",5.0

"I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that this instrument might have turned me into a primarily fretless player.  I play my other bases just to keep in practice with them.  Fretless basses have a very unique sound, so you don't want to just show up for an audition with it, unless the band you are seeking is specifically looking for that sound. Thus, I need to play the fretted bass to stay in the game. But, I really do like playing this. It's what I reach for first.  It takes some practice making sure your finger land in the right place. But he action on this is so low, and your fingers just move around easier. If you are looking to slam your bass around, don't even look at this. This bass is all about finesse.  If you have big fat fingers, get a Fender - this is not for you.

 I think this bass is a work of art.  I would hang it on my living room wall. The wood and finish is beautiful.  My only complaint is that a solder came loose inside that needed repair.  Other than that, I love it.",5.0

"I bought this amp to have something reliable to back up my Diamond Assassin. I was initally pleased at how nice the clean channel sounded. When I tried the drive/more drive channel, I was thouroughly dissappointed, goes double for the reverb! I have a lot of really nice pedals which is what you will have to play in the pre out, power in inputs if you wnat anything besides clean. With that said, I did a little investigating on some Fender forums, and found out quite a bit about the weaknesses of this amp. The reliability issue mainly stems from two power resistors who's wattage rating(5 watts), are almost maxed out by the wattage running through them, 4.8 watts. They heat up enough that they can desolder the solder points. Easy fix, swap them out for 10 watt resistors (I used resistors w/ heatsinks). There are two 50V capacitors right by them in the same signal path that appeared to be leaking, again, easy fix, use the same value cap, but up the voltage rating to 63V, or even a 100V. For sound quality, the first thing I did was swap out the little made in china reverb tank with a proper Accutronics ""long"" tank. The reverb still was a little light on volumn- but there was the classic Fender Spring reverb I was looking for! You can address the reverb volumn by changing a few resistors on the board, which I did, and now my reverb sounds great. There are a number of capacitor/resistor/potentiometer changes that address the drive channel, that will eliminate the awful hiss when using the drive channel, while also increasing the gain- lots of potential in this amp if your willing to spend a little cash and time. I almost forgot, swap out the two 8 ohm speakers for something worthwhile. I used a Guitar wharehouse ""Reaper 50 watter, and a ET65 in combo. Remember, new speakers always need some time to break in. I now possess a Fender amp that is very useable. More reliable with great tone, even in the drive channel.",3.0
Finally a fully functional keyboard with options I can use. The Casio Privia 860 is a nice upgrade to every second hand clunker accoustic Ive had during my adult piano purchasing life.

"So I just got this little thing and I love it!  It sounds like the ukulele music I hear in my head when I think of ukulele.  I know all the uke purists are eager to bash on this brand, but you know what?  I like the sound of it, and I have fun while I'm playing it.  And that's really what's important.  Are you going to want to keep playing?  With this, the answer is yes for me.  I played as many other brands as I could get my hands on before buying this one.  Maybe I'll outgrow the Luna, maybe not.  I've played guitar for years, so this is a pretty easy step for me, but I'm still a beginner.  As to the specifics,  it's all Koa and looks to be solid as it's advertised.  I have a laminated spruce top guitar that I use as a camping guitar, and this does not appear to be laminated.  The strings that came with it are indeed Aquila strings as they had the Aquila tag on the instrument. They are not clear as pictured. If I can figure out how to add pics I will.  The pickup is quite loud and works well.  But that brings me to the reason I give it four stars.  The pickup is so sensitive that it gives off a sound like a ""P"" pop from a mic if you are too heavy handed. I had to drop the bass all the way down to thin the sound and make it sound like a uke through my PA.  Also the finish, while being satin, is a little rough.  It looks really nice but if you run your hands over it you feel little bumps and edges that just shouldn't be there.  All in all, though I really like it and it's exactly what I was looking for.  A small, fun, portable instrument.  I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, traditional Koa ukulele.

UPDATE:  I'm changing my review to five stars.  I still love this little instrument, and have since learned to play several tunes on it.  The reason I've decided to change my review, is simply this.  I had a question about the nut and saddle on the uke (they're made of Nubone, by Graphtech, by the way) and shot an email off to the maker via their website.  I got a response the very next day, and from the founder of the company no less.  She was very friendly and helpful. Other instrument companies could take a note from them.",5.0

"This is the first review I've written for a musical instrument device. I am 62 years old and have been playing since I was 13. I play everything from reggae and New Orleans funk to acoustic ballads, although I don't gig much anymore. I have owned more FX pedals than I can remember, and only a few have instantly caught my attention when I plugged it in. This is one of them. I'm always looking for dirt-cheap pedals that belie their lowly price, and the EHX Soul Food might be the absolute king in this regard. The minute I plugged it in I was blown away with how easily I was able to conjure up tones that I am always searching for with guitars, amps and effects. I couldn't stop playing and lost myself in my music, whereas most pedals have me playing a few chords or licks, adjusting the knobs, playing some more, adjusting the knobs, etc... Impressive just in that sense. Even if it doesn't earn a permanent place on my pedalboard, it will for sure be my current grab 'n' go OD pedal when I don't need my full pedalboard, like on a blues date. To put this in perspective, I have owned a few really great OD/distortion pedals over the years. The original ProCo Rat, rack-mount Butler Real Tube (damn, I wish I still had that), Scholz Rockman (hey, don't laugh - that thing was great in the studio), Analogman King of Tone (I want that one back, too), Keeley-modified Tube Screamer (TS-9) and BD-2 Blues Driver, Lovepedal Eternity and Amp 11,  etc... and I'm currently auditioning a Way Huge Saucy Box. Dollar for dollar, nothing comes close to the EHX Soul Food. I've never owned a Klon or a Timmy and have no idea if the SF resembles either one of them, but I don't care. This thing is fun! I am currently comparing the SF and the Saucy Box (also a great pedal and a real bargain) and they are quite similar in ways. The Saucy Box has a little better note clarity, slightly better bass response and a slightly lower noise floor, and might be an even better choice for large combo amps, half-stacks, etc... But hey! For less than $70 I've got myself a go-to clean boost/OD pedal that is versatile enough for just about everything except the more metallic music genres. If it breaks or gets stolen, no big deal. So get one. Even if you don't like it, one of your friends certainly will when you gift it to them! Bravo EHX!

p.s. I have owned both of the Danelectro Transparent Overdrives which were also great bang-for-the-buck pedals. The Soul Food chews up and spits out both of them.",5.0

It's only 1 inch so I didn't expect too much difference in the sound of the room but was surprised to find that the room was noticeably more dead and reflection free.  I wouldn't use it as the only acoustic treatment (I already have 6 bass traps) but in combination with other treatment it works great.

This is NOT soundproofing.  This stuff will in no way reduce the sound from outside, it's meant to stop reverb and echo inside the room.",5.0
"I really like this tuner, despite a pretty major problem I had with it initially.
There are almost no instructions with the tuner, so I took it out of the box, checked it, and promptly used it to tune my mandolin.
The readout was very unclear and I popped an E string because the key it was set to looked like a different letter. Oops.
It seems to keep a charge for a long time, and it works well once you figure out that C's are not B's, no matter how much they might look like one in tiny digital readouts.",4.0

"The good:  Very easy to install and remove, dampens the sound effectively, and imparts a very cool tenor-guitar-style sound to my tenor banjo.

The bad:  I have a thin custom bridge, and this doesn't clamp on securely enough to really do anything unless I push it all the way down to the head, where the bridge is wider.  That's fine and all, but then it doesn't reach far enough across the bridge to dampen the fourth string.

By the way, if I play a certain single note, this thing causes the octave to sound as well.  It sounds fine still, but I thought it was strange enough to be worth a mention.

Edit:  There seems to be some variation between these.  I bought a second after losing the first one, and it clips on more tightly and mutes more effectively.",3.0

"About 10-12 years ago, after only playing guitar for 2 years or so, I was kind of under the impression there was some sort of item out there I could buy that would make my playing and sound better. This led to throwing money at different effects, picks, and strings. Trying out coated strings that cost 2-3 times more than a typical set of strings, I went on for a few years playing them, thinking they actually made a difference. After those couple years, my playing had improved, and upon playing a friends guitar, I quickly noticed the lack of any kind of huge difference between his cheap strings and my expensive strings. So I went back to my $5-6 faithful D'Addarios, and had been using them ever since.

Enter NYXL, When I first saw them, my immediate thought was, ""looks like D'Addario is getting into the expensive strings game."" and quickly dismissed them. However, I gave them a second thought when I saw the players from the band Periphery used them. Those guys had really given me a new inspiration recently, after quitting a band I was in, I didn't have the gravitation towards the guitar I did until I started getting into these guys, so I've become interested in their gear, style, etc. So I figured, why not, and gave them a shot.

These things are awesome, from the sustain and brightness they offer, to their new ""Balanced Tension,"" which makes it so that you use the same amount of tension for all of your bends. They also tend to stay in tune better than cheaper strings. Most importantly, the feel. I originally bought my first set almost a year ago for my Explorer. I had regular D'Addarios in it, and putting the NYXL's in, I could hear and feel the immediate, positive difference. I was sort of blown away. I wasn't expecting anything, really, but it was enough of a difference for me to want to make the change. I should also mention the longevity. Those said strings I put in my Explorer almost a year ago? They're still there, same set. I'm not an avid, change strings every two weeks type of person, but I usually do every 2-3 months, but still, I'm not in any hurry to order up some new ones.",5.0

"after spending a little more than a year going from clonewheel to clonewheel, I have finally found my organ. I've tried the old, analogue VISCOUNT OP3, the voce v5+. the voce Micro b, the Voce v3 plus midi drawbars, the Oberhiem ob3 squared,I've used all of them with Voce Spin II rotary simulators, plus the Motion sound Pro 3x,not to mention 2 different Speakeasy tube pre amps. I bought all of these, plus i tried the Korgs, the Rolands,.....none of them measured up to what i remembered over a year ago when i played the Nord electro 3.  Well,,,,the Nord C2  is even better. I wasn't too interested in any of the Hammond xk's , or the SK's....I probably would like them too, but I couldn't get the overall desireability of the Nord c2 out of my head.  It was just TOO seductive to pass up. I'm burned out on organ modules, synth keybeds, multiple stands, stomp boxes, pre amps, signal chains with up to ELEVEN power cords alone.....I had this set up with my bass pedalboard, roland ev5 expression pedal, & roland dp2 rotary toggle swithc in less than 3 minutes.  And the SOUND.....this had the grind, the growl, the howl, the purr, the KRUNCH !  I haven't even hooked it up to my Motion sound yet....I LOVE the onboard sim by itself....the drawbuttons are not difficult to deal with, you have the live buffers you can use for the more involved drawbar configurations,  like 888888888 or 800008888) & the overdrive is STUNNING !

The sound is a undeniably tinny, but full chord voicing with harmony is produced. The build and design quality was good overall, but mine had its screw-in strap pin hole stripped, so that the pin falls out easily. I will need to put in some wood filler along the bore hole and rethread a path for the screw. I use it a lot when traveling or when relaxing on our boat; it's small enough to keep on a boat, in a closet, behind a door, or in a corner of an office. the case is strong, so it survives air travel without worries. It holds a tuning between uses.

Then you couple that with the shock mount and a pop filter, and you have a large heavy load for a tiny arm to handle. the RODE PSA1 is handling it no problem, the motion is smooth, easy to handle, and it stays where I put it. Happy I spent a little more on this arm, the difference in quality is apparent once it's set up. I didn't read all the fine print, so I was happy to see it came with two mounting options too - a typical clamp style that's easy to move around, or a more permanent mount, if you want to take a hole saw to your desk and/or mounting surface.",5.0

"thank you for a quick safe delivery. I really like the Qchord and am having a lot of fun with it. I like that you can make just about any chord you need and that I can play it with one hand when my right hand is hurting.

"I got this as a birthday present for my 2 year old. He has always been in love with bubbles, but I just don't have the wind power to continually blow bubbles for him out of a conventional bubble wand. It seemed like he was always asking for more, no matter how many bubbles I blew.

With the Bubbletron, I can just fill it up, turn it on, and let him get his bubbles on for as long as he wants. Finally he can play and enjoy running through/catching/popping bubble to his heart's content.

And as far as quantity, this thing makes ALOT of bubbles. I assume it is more so meant for professional use, but we love it for at home. The bubbles aren't EXTREMELY large, but they are a good size... and the shear amount of how many there are, completely make up for the bubbles' size.

Also, I have only tried this with bubble solution I bought at the dollar tree, ""Super Miracle Bubbles"", brand. I imagine that this is probably some of the lowest quality solution money can buy, but the Bubbletron still works perfectly with it.

I am excited to make my own bubble solution and see how well it works with higher quality stuff :)

"I will preface this with saying I am completely new to the violin but I am careful in tuning. I didn't need much, so I didn't ask much of this instrument. That said, I was extremely disappointed in this product. The instrument came with the bridge and strings already on. That was worrying to me because the strings can get stretched out during shipping and storage. Sure enough, none of the strings would hold their tune. Adjusting one meant the other pegs would slide loose, and the fine tuners were all but worthless. When trying to tighten the A string, it snapped and hit me in the thumb. I was facing the instrument, so it was extremely lucky my face wasn't hit. Even still, I have a red welt and no love for this thing. Shipping it with the strings and bridge on made them stretch out of tune. I know it's a cheap violin, but I didn't need anything more than those dang pegs to hold in place. Even if I could get some peg drops and new strings, it's a lost cause. I could play a tub with strings better than this.",1.0

"I've had this bass for a few months now, and all I can say is that it's probably one of the best basses I've ever played and/or owned. Right out of the box I could tell it was a quality instrument. Fit and finish were flawless, the action and setup were good, only requiring very minimal tweaking to get it to where I like it. The neck with the satin finish feels great, the fretwork was excellent. And the tone, with the Duncan designed pickups , has a definite vintage Fender vibe. On top of all that, with the natural finish along with the maple fretboard and the Block inlays and binding (don't let anyone tell you they're painted on, they are the real thing) this bass looks simply gorgeous. I would not hesitate to use this at a gig.

"I've played for 30-plus years, five or six professionally back in the day.  But no brand of strings ever became ""must haves"" for me.  The gauge (thickness) of a set is more important ... medium, light, extra light depending on the instrument, but that's about it.  It's easy to over-think strings, after all the ""plain"" variety (E, B on acoustic guitars, E, B, G on electrics) are all basically identical - the  majority worldwide are manufactured by just two companies, Mapes Piano Wire in the United States and Roslau in Germany.

The wound strings are where brands differentiate in quality and design.  The premium is always on 'life expectancy.' That is, how long will new strings sound clear and bright before they flatten with age and lose their new-string sound?  D'Addario has developed a process called EXP ... it's a thin coating of the phosphor-bronze winding, like these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Addario-EXP16-Phosphor-Bronze-Light-Acoustic/dp/B0002E3CJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D'Addario EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light - Acoustic</a>.

D'Addario stakes a bold position, claiming EXP-coated strings last 4 times longer than traditional strings.  I've been pounding away on these for more than a month now, and honestly the brightness has not yet diminished.  I'm still a long way from the ""four times longer"" point, but thusfar there is no loss of brightness and clarity.  I'll amend this text when I have more data, seems unlikely they quadruple the lifespan of other strings, but so far, so good.",4.0

Throw a ripped up catalog for 2017 gear (when it's 11 days from 2018), add in a torn instruction sheet (not that you need either it but it's the principal) and toss it in the mail. Oh and don't forget the best way to mess it up, leave a plastic edge so sharp on one of the knobs it cuts the finger of the poor person who assembles it. And just to top it off, make sure it's crooked as all get out.

Seriously I know it was only 10 bucks, get what ya pay for and all that, but come on ChromaCast, take some pride in your product.",1.0
"I'm a long-time B-flat player (30 years), but new to bass clarinet, so naturally I was shocked at the price of ""regular"" reeds. I got this one and another synthetic reed, hoping the investment would be worth it and it totally was! The other one I got was a plastic reed and I'm not a fan. The fibracell is amazing! It really does sound like real wood and makes it easy for me to reach both high and low notes. I've gotten so many compliments on my sound from other players. I play on it about 1-2 times per week and have had it for 2 months now. It is still going strong. FYI, I use a Vandoren 2.5, so I got a Fibracell 2.5 based on reviews here and it is perfect! (If you're new to bass clarinet, you will need a softer reed than for B-flat. I play on a Vandoren 3.5 V-12 on my B-flat, but anything harder than a 2.5 on my bass is too hard for me)",5.0

"My friend has two of these; he highly recommended this microphone, so I bought one.  This has become my every-day use microphone.  He uses his mic for on-stage for live performances, because, like a good hand-held stage mic, it has noise and extraneous noise rejection from anywhere but where it's pointed at, and in very close proximity is the key feature of this microphone.  I like the sound I get from this mic.  I like the quality of recorded tracks I get from this mic.  If you don't have the pristine recording studio conditions, and are looking for a mic that sounds really good and has excellent noise rejection from the environment, this microphone is a good choice.  The quality of the sound of this mic has me considering other AKG microphones now.  Thanks AKG.",5.0

"Update: The Direct Sounds Customer Service folks resolved my issue within minutes of sending them an email. They are sending me a new replacement part ""HBB2925 Replacement Headband - New Improved- Fits All"" that is expected to resolve the issue. Excellent customer service.

Below is the email I wrote them that describes the problem I was facing:

Dear Direct Sound Folks,

I purchased your Direct Sound EX29 Extreme Isolation Headphones (Black) via Amazon. I loved them during my daily commute from New Jersey to Manhattan on public transit. They were excellent at shutting off external background sounds. Sadly, the plastic construction of the headband is very weak and the headband broke during my normal (I'd even say gentle) use within just a few weeks. I tried reconnecting it using Gorilla Glue, but  didn't succeed. As a result, I'm no longer able to use these otherwise  excellent sound isolating headphones.

I noticed on the your Web site [...] that you used to sell a replacement part ""HB2925 Replacement Headband - original - Fits All"" which their site says is ""No Longer Available"" and has been replaced by a new part ""HBB2925 Replacement Headband - New Improved- Fits All"" that costs $14.95. This seems to indicate you are aware you original headband was faulty. I feel it is unfair that you are charging $14.95 to replace a faulty part in your product that you seem to know about. Your product was excellent while it lasted. I would like to request you to consider sending me a replacement headset since I believe that would be fair. Thank you in advance. Best regards,",5.0

"My daughter is 7 and needed a new bow when we bought a used violin.  I got her a cheap Chinese bow from Amazon in February which worked fine for about 3 months and then the spacer fell out.  For this size, getting a new bow is cheaper than re-hairing her existing bow.  I went with a different brand (this one) and it arrived in horrible condition:  the hairs were falling out and tangled and wouldn't tighten so I sent it back. I sucked it up and bought a quality bow from a local shop at more than twice the price but my hope is that the quality bow will function until she moves to the next violin size.

My advice is: save your time and hassle.  Buy a quality bow from a reputable dealer and not from Amazon.  You will pay more (I think I paid $60) but even a small person deserves a decent bow.",1.0

"I purchased a low G red for my Tenor. I spend 3 days bring it up to pitch very slowly and hand stretched the strings as I usually do. The string broke just shy of reaching ""G"".  I not a fan of wire wound strings and was willing to tune it slowly, but after following the recommendation and still failing, I won't try again. I am sure there is a problem with the product.  Maybe it's an inconsistency in production or maybe it's just to brittle, but until I see more reports of success I won't bother to try them again.

I did stop tuning for over a day when I reached ""F"", detuned my other strings by a note and listened to the stings sound quality.  It has a slightly less focused sound than the other strings. Almost a bit fuzzy. I wasn't impressed, but it may have sounded better if I had been able to hear tuned to ""G"". So, unfortunately, I'm not sure they're worth it even if the strings didn't break.

"Best value in a basic 88 key digital piano on the market. Would have cost $2k only 5 years ago. Key weighting is lovely (and even graded = key weight + electronic sensitivity simulate requiring progressively slightly more key velocity/impact for same relative volume from highest to lowest notes - similar to physics of a real piano due to hammer/action/string mass), sounds are excellent and musical (I have a Yamaha C7 full grand, so my ear is very attuned to the real thing) & the internal speakers actually sound great. Simplicity of using piano keys to change sounds, set metronome speed, etc. is a bit odd, but quite easy once you get the hang of it. Light, portable, basic midi, good headphone jack, music stand, decent basic sustain pedal...all included and ready to go. This was purchased for a 4th grade up and coming piano star for his personal practice area and he is utterly over the top delighted!  Impossibly amazing for the price.",5.0

I am very pleased with the stand. It appears just as the picture of it. I have been using it for about a month with no accidental tipovers. It is rugged and the part that goes into the bell of the clarinet appears to be velvet so it doesn't scratch the inside of the bell. The legs of the base fold inward for easy transporting. My only request would be that the design should incorporate some way to attach the upper part to the base after it's broken down (unscrewed). I heartly recommend it.,5.0

"This knob-tightening design is much more effective than tension designs where tightening an adjustment screw increases spring tension. Yes, the knob desigh does take a little more time to move the capo because the knob must be un-tightened first, but IMHO the knob design very easily puts as much pressure as you want on the strings and is not susceptable to spring fatigue over time. Also, there are no obnoxious protrusions from the capo which can get in the way while playing and storing the guitar. Especially if you leave a capo on your guitar most of the time, this is the capo for you. Most of my guitars have a permanently mounted capo on the first fret; then I tune it to the standard EADGBE (with the capo). This lowers the action of the strings as far as possible by eliminating the rise of the nut. Helps to make a much smoother-playing guitar, especially if the saddle-height and neck-bow are also set right. If you don't want to spend $100 or thereabouts on a professional setup, this simple trick gets you a good way there. Of course you have to get used to the fret marls being one fret off all the time, I thought about making an overlay to shift the marks, but then I realized after a few weeks that my brain had adjusted to the offset by itself.",5.0

Using the internal battery, I have to set my software to +30dB gain to get much of anything from it.  While the directionality works quite well, the downside is that if it is used where air is moving, forget it.  Nothing but noise.  You can't really hand-hold it; just the blood moving in your hand will be picked up.  With a computer, the vibrations will be heard and with a video camera the zoom and every touch of the tripod will be picked up.

"I held off buying the ST-200 for years as it seemed like a lot to spend for a tuner.  Now I'm wondering why I waited so long!  It's the best money I've spent on a piece of guitar gear in a long time.  It's a true strobe tuner, so it's way more accurate than anything else (other than another strobe tuner of course).  Finally a tuner accurate enough that I'm not hearing pitch problems after tuning, and also good enough to set intonation during setups and in the studio.  It's also small and light for a strobe unit.  It takes up only a small patch of real estate on a pedal board, and is very easy to read and use on stage.  The auto mute while tuning and true bypass when not engaged are also great features, along with the ability to be programmed for alternate/drop tunings.  It's about as good as a product can be, and worth every penny if you want to be exactly in tune every time with minimal fuss.  There is a reason why you seldom see these for sale used (I know I looked).  Once you have one, you will never go back to anything else.",5.0

"I just installed them behind my computer desk and around my TV that's above it.  It was simple and very easy to set up with a little common sense and some basic background knowledge of electronics.  They don't get warm and the adhesive on the back is more than enough for my smooth wooden finished desk and TV, but it did have some trouble sticking to my wall, which has random bumps and lines coming out of it as it's style.

I saw a lot of reviews saying it didn't come with instructions, so if you need help setting this up, here are the things you need to get it going:

1.  An adapter.  Any 12V adapter should do.  I used this one:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O66YOK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

2. Wire strippers.  Any old wire stripper will do.  I'm sure everyone probably knows somebody with a pair of wire strippers.

3.  Some knowledge of how to put the wires together.  There are a few options, the best ones are smoldering them together or using a controller.  I prefer the controller as it doesn't require a smoldering tool and it lets you control the brightness.

For smoldering, watch just watch an old tutorial on YouTube
For using a controller, I recommend either this product:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4KKF2/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

or this one: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHU2U7O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2WG712ZXNEBTQ&coliid=I9NC235WLBCYK

I bought the first one but after going back here to write this review I stumbled upon the wireless control one and I believe it might work with these as well.  However, the second one with the remote will still require smoldering (I think, someone correct me if not), so if you really need a remote controlled one and know how to put wires together then this looks like a good choice.  As for the first one, it was easy as cake to install.

Just remember for those who don't mess around with wiring too much, Red=Positive and Black=Negative.  The power supply adapter on the other hand shouldn't matter.  Just split up the two wires after stripping them and put them in the ""In"" sockets (this is for the first dimmer I linked).",5.0

"Pros:

Diverse tone variations wth simple and familiar controls
Seemingly good quality design and build
Analog circuitry (very quiet output with no ""digital"" flavor)
Very good quality at a very low cost

Cons:
None noted so far

I wanted a guitar tone control to improve and simplify home recording. I was using a Boss BR800 and Fender Champion 40 Amp as front ends into a Tascam DP32SD, both of which worked but were not ideal. The Boss has a clumsy and complex interface based on a tiny screen and awkward touch buttons. Adding a little treble was a 30 second exercise. The Fender Champion amp is a delight to use, with simple and useful controls, but it's too noisy for recording. Also, both of those devices have that ""digital"" sound that is hard to describe, but you know it when you hear it.

So I went looking for a simple amp ""front end"" having a quiet, flexible output via analog circuitry. I found a few fancy gadgets with lots of amp simulations, mic positions, etc.  I didn't want all that confusion, and all those devices were clearly (or likely) digital.  This Joyo, however, seemed like a low risk solution having the limited features and analog design that I wanted. After a brief test I think I found a winner.

The construction quality seems very robust, with a substantial metal case and firm, smoothly turning controls. The sound goes from squeaky clean to serious overdrive based on settings of the voice and gain controls.  The unit behaves like a variety of tube amp front ends, presumably a Fender style,  that provides all the guitar tone shaping that I need.  And it does it quickly and easily with the same controls that I have used for 50 years.

If you seek a simple amp front end for recording or connecting directly into a sound board then give this low cost gadget a try.  I'm sure glad that I bought mine.",5.0
"I am very new to piano playing so I don't have much to compare with. Overall I think the piano is good. I have two complaints:

1) As others have said the tangents are very noisey when you release them. If you go to a shop to try out the piano be sure you can live with that. Also beware that it may sound not as bad in the shop as at home as the shop may be a big room with allot of noise.

2) The metronome is not very loud compared to the piano itself. As a beginner you may want to turn down the volume of the piano to not anoy other people with your playing. But then the metronome may be almost impossible to hear. It would have been great if the volumes could be independently adjusted.",4.0

"This unit has replaced a vintage rackmount ART T2 and X15 midi controller.  There is nothing comparable to this killer.  From the price, the effects, ease of operation, to the construction, the RP 500 is the perfect solution to the multitude of expensive stomps you could be spending money on.  The X-Edit software beats the heck out of using the knobs and switches to edit the parameters, but it's good to know how to if you're out on a gig without your computer (I'm lazy, so I carry a little netbook with the X-Edit installed on it).  Downloaded the looper from the Digitech website.  What else could I need?  The only improvement I could see is to have two expression pedals (like the X15 did) instead of one.  So, I added an Ernie Ball volume pedal and ...TAH DAH!!...I've got all I need to get ANY sound I want!",5.0
"I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews. I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:

- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.
- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.
- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less ""alive""/resonant during playing.
- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.
- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.
- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.
- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.
- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.
- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!

All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.

I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull to me is over-hyped.

"I have always been skeptical of new string brands.  It's rare that I see and hear a clear difference among string brands.  Vibe Strings are different.

These strings are made in the USA from the highest quality materials.  The packaging is attractive, the strings come individually wrapped in paper envelopes.  This is so much better than when strings are packed 2 or 3 deep in an envelope because they come unraveled and it can be confusing.

The strings were easy to string on the guitar and have a wonderful feel to them.  Not slippery, but with just the correct amount of sheen and smoothness.  The sound is outstanding.  You will notice a vast improvement in the resonance of your guitar.  Open chords ring out long and sound sweet and rich.  The strings have the perfect balance between high and low, with none of the tinny and thin sound I have found in other brands.  These strings also tune up fast and intonate perfectly.

The bottom line is these strings will make your guitar sound better, be it a 300 dollar practice guitar or a 3,000 dollar treasure.

"These are my favorite headphones for listening to opera.  The sound is clear and present, full-bodied and rich.

But they're not terribly comfortable and they don't last long - maybe a year or two.  Mine broke at the ear cup hinge.  A friend was able to tape them together, so I can get a bit more mileage out of them, but now they're somewhat twisted at the left ear cup and don't sit properly over my ear.

It's a pity - these headphones delivered the best quality sound I had found for listening to opera.  As I've searched for a new pair, I'm not able to locate any headphones that sound as good as these do.

"Imagine my surprise when I bot my new pop filter and I saw just how massive it was! The nady MPF-6 is an impressive tool for sure, and it never once has failed to help with removing some of those annoying plosives you get during an audio recording. However, prospective buyers should be aware of just WHAT this products intended purpose is and how it will help you. It won't magically make the quality of your audio improve. If you are using a generic desktop mic or headset, and especially if your mouth isn't very close to the mic when you record, you aren't that likely to notice the difference the Nady MPF-6 makes. Where it shines truly is removing the distortions caused by your breath when you speak closely to the mic.

As for the bad, its not much more than a minor gripe really, but I found that the size of the Nady MPF-6 sometimes made it difficult to use in my very cramped work space. Though for those of you out there who have roomy workspaces you aren't as likely to see a problem in this regard.",4.0

"UPDATE:  after a half dozen gigs, this unit (transmitter) started popping and making unwanted noises.  It seems to be the output jack where it mounts to the circuit board.  I opened it up and couldn't find anything loose.  I was disappointed to learn that Line 6 does not provide technical support!  They suggest if you have any problems you contact an authorized repair shop.  I tried two repair shops on their list.  Both said they may or may not be able to fix it, but would have to charge for repair because Line 6 will not pay them.  And any repair will cost more than I paid for the unit.

So it is unuseable for gigs now, after only six uses. That's unacceptable.

(original review)

I just gigged with this wireless unit last night for the first time and it was exactly what I wanted and hoped for.  Perfect digital sound, instant set up - just plug it in and play it.

I use it on a bass guitar through an SWR 450, direct connect to p.a.  My bass sounded WAY better than it ever has.  I'm not sure how much of that is due to the digital wireless and how much is the new flat wound strings I put on.  I probably should have done one step at a time.  Anyway, it sounded better than ever - the tone and clarity was astonishing.  No buzzing, popping, no noise whatsoever, even when turning on or off, and in and out of the jack with the amp and volume on.  Pure clean tone.

The transmitter is very compact, fits easily with other pedals in a pedal board.  The led lights are cool too.

One problem, (not the fault of the unit). I was clipping the transmitter unit to my strap at the peg and it fell off four times, landing SPLAT on the floor.  The back battery cover popped off twice.  But no damage, I put it back together and it kept going.  I would like to mount it more permanently, maybe using my strap case, but I trade guitars with another player for some songs using a different strap so that wouldn't work.  I will just start putting it in my pocket instead of clipping it on the strap.  It proved to be durable, anyway.

I recommend this unit, it is a hell of a lot better than the cheap analog AKG, Nady, and AudioTechnica units I have used before and the price is sure right.  It does not come with a power supply, so plan on (a) plugging it into a multi-power 9V, such as a pedal board, (b) using a 9V battery, or (c) getting a 9V 100mA DC adapter, about ten bucks on Amazon.  Be careful about getting an adapter - you need to make sure that the outer shell of the connector is + and the inner pin is -.  Many adapters are just the opposite, and that would fry the unit in a heartbeat.",5.0
"I have these on an epiphone masterbilt aj500M and they sound pretty good, the highs are a little overwhelming and sparkly when the strings are new, but after a couple days of playing and a few hours exposure to my corrosive hand oils (which is why I should buy the Elixer strings, but I don't) they tone down and are more mellow.

"Bought this to provide audio for presenters at a weekend conference.

In fact, it was necessary to put the mic up to the mouth to get a decent sound level.

I returned this unit and bought a more expensive system from a well-known audio/microphone manufacturer to replace it, which works far better.

"Oh Man,

There is so much gibberish written about guitars it would fill the Library of Congress. Bottom line, if you can't play, spending $3,000 and bragging about your new Martin (or Taylor) will not help you. Nor will any effects boxes known to man.  A good guitarist can get a good sound out of a milk crate. It's that simple.  I, like others on here, went to a guitar store, and tried about about 100 guitars before settling on this one. I do a lot of finger picking and I chose this OVER a few $3,000 models of various brands that sound too hard. I even like the lower-end electronics on this--they are crisper and less artificial. The guitar has an incredibly tender sound if you play it correctly. It is an INSTRUMENT.  There are so many players these days who are notorious for guitar snobbery, then they get on stage, click a few pedals and give you the same G, C and D chords over and over again that sound like everyone else. They can't read music, they don't know any notes, they have no idea about any fundamentals of chord theory whatsoever, they have no technique and they can't play. So who cares? Hey, I have a $99 Lauren that I will put up against any guitar any day of the week if you would like to do some real picking. That being said, ignore all gibberish about guitar models and prices. Learn how to play and then buy the one that sounds good.  If anyone wants to hear what this thing sounds like with NO EFFECTS, you can go to [...] and click on the song Eclipse for a Day. This is what the guitar can do.

"Top quality device.  Not made in China, too.  Compression is mild compared to other makes and models.  But there are internal DIP switches for minor tweaking.  No tone control or blend.  This is a leave it on all the time pedal, controlled by guitar volume knob primarily to vary attack and sustain.  I set the pedal volume slightly above unity, back off the guitar volume knob at the sweet spot, then max the guitar volume knob for a change in dynamics, fills, or solos.  Uses both 9v battery or appropriate AC adapter; it's good having the option.  The cables are a nice bonus, although they are cheap and MIC and should only be used in non-crucial situation such as when you are just sitting around noodling.  I have the Xotic EP boost; another fine pedal  that is in constant use.  I will be purchasing their more full featured pedals now that my appetite has been whetted.  I have experience with the AC Boost and will probably be going with that.",5.0
"I started learning to play in 1958. I have had Serenader, Stella, Harmony, Espana, Gibson, Mosrite and Martin guitars. This is my first Chinese Guitar. I bought this guitar ""open box"" from Guitar City and it was sent UPS to my house. It plays easier than my Martin D15M, has plenty of volume and good sound for a $130 guitar and it came with D'Addario medium strings. The tuners are cheap but functional for now. I had to tighten one. The intonation is great, no fret buzz. I figure someone did a setup before it got to me. The appearance is excellent. I would recommend this instrument to buskers who don't want to take their more expensive instruments to the streets and to beginners. At home and with friends I will play my Martin and Gibson C/W but in the street and on road trips I think this guitar will serve me well.",4.0
"This tuner is amazing. It fits right onto the guitar and has a big, clear reading for feedback on the note. Its color coding makes it simple to determine if the note is sharp or flat or right in tune, and adjust accordingly if necessary. We already have two of these, and we keep giving them to friends who admire them and need one; we plan to buy at least two more (we have a lot of musicians in the family)!",5.0

"Ive been a musician for 26 years.  Piano and trumpet were always my main instruments, but after years of not playing the trumpet, I decided to try something new and learn alto saxophone.  I had one that I had picked up when I used to teach music, so I joined a community band and started learning about six months ago.

Obviously, having only been playing for six months, Im not an incredible player by any means; however, with my existing musical background, Im proud of the progress Ive made.  The one thing I knew without a doubt was that the instrument I was playing was about as bad as it gets; Ive NEVER seen an even remotely positive review of it online.  So, when I stumbled across this beauty one day while looking for cases, I figured I had nothing to lose.

I knew I was taking a gamble when purchasing this instrument.  The reviews go to extremes, and Im a little suspicious of the really good ones.  When it arrived, Ill have to admit I was as nervous as I was excited.

First Impressions:
When I took it out of the case, I could tell immediately its not a high quality instrument.  It has a very strong chemical smell that permeated my entire house quickly, even with the windows open.  Upon initial inspection of the horn, I can tell that the attention to detail in the styling is lacking.  From a distance, its beautiful.  Hold it in your hands and its obvious that youve gotten what youve paid for.

An important thing to note about this review; I never even tried the mouthpiece or reeds that came with the instrument.  I used my Premier by Hite mouthpiece and tried both Vandoren 2's and Rico Plasticover 2's.

The sound it produced initially was fuller than that of my old horn.  Low notes (down to low C), were easy to play.  High notes (up to high C) were fairly easy.  (In all fairness, Ive never quite mastered that high E on any saxophone.)  The notes in the middle left me a little frustrated.  From D up to about G#, the horn wants to drop an octave.  I found myself having to change my embouchure just to maintain the pitch, and even then, it was unsteady.  It seemed to take a little more effort than my old sax and a lot more air.

It is fairly comfortable to hold.  Im short (52). but I like to hold my sax straight up and down in the front rather than off to the side.  On my old horn, this meant having to hold my head at an odd angle.  On this one, the neck is bent down a little, making this position far more comfortable.  Thats a plus.  However, I cheat (I rest the horn on my chair, even though I know thats bad).  After just ten minutes of playing, the paint had rubbed off the bottom of the horn completely.  It kind of makes me wonder how long before it all starts coming off.

The case looks nice, but when you open it up, its awful.  It is so cheap.  The inside is cheap Styrofoam.  Even just pulling the instrument out, you can hear it crushing.  Id give this case six months tops before it disintegrates completely.

Im going to give this instrument a fair shake.  Ill practice on it and my old horn for the next several days and see how I feel about it.  I may even take it to rehearsal.  But based on first impressions, Im expecting this instrument won't be in my house long.

Update: After a few more hours of playing this instrument then switching back to my old horn, its sadly obvious that Ive taken a step backwards.  I will be returning it.  My community band director took one look at it and said, Well, thats a nice toy, and pretty much hinted that hed prefer I never use it in a concert.  If it had been my first sax, I may have learned to like it, but my hope was to upgrade, not downgrade.  And trust me, that wouldnt have taken much from my other instrument!

Update: I was able to return this instrument with no problem, and my account was credited accordingly.",2.0
"All I was looking for was something I could stuff under my computer table, since my regular SWR rig is not much fun to move around.  I plugged it in expecting there to be some input clipping or speaker distortion from the low B of my 18-volt active 6-string, maybe some ambient noise, a choked sound and other things that I've come to expect from ""practice"" amps.  Instead, I got a quieter version of what I get when I plug in to my ""play-out"" gear.  It's actually pretty impressive.  It is small. It doesn't get very loud, but it DOES sound great.  I was even able to plug into the -0db input to get a bit more volume.  It did begin to distort when I played harder than I usually do, but I was plugged into the ""wrong"" input and started turning the tone knobs up.  I haven't yet played with the line out, but if it sounds like what's coming out of the tiny 8"" speaker, it's more than good.  If you want a great sounding amp for VERY little money, this is an A+ product.  Remember, it won't shake the neighbor's house and it will clip/distort if you push it, but that's not what it was designed for.",5.0

The red light on the cable does come and and the ""in"" light does light, but I'm thinking the ""built in"" driver to this is not correctly sending the message to the computer sofware.  The ""out"" light never has come on.

"The Guitar is nice. I put new strings on it and tweeked it a little and it plays and sounds incredible.

My problem is that I own several high end 3 voice guitars. All of them have the magnetic and the piezo pickup on a TRS cable. This one has a separate cable for each so I can't change guitars (to the Multiac Jazz) without changing cables. it's annoying.

Now my real complaint! Godin doesn't answer their emails. I have emailed [...] 3 times to tell them that I love the guitar but can they give me info so that I can make this guitar work on my system. They don't write!!! They don't say we're looking at solutions or we don't think we can help you or anything at all. I own 3 Godin guitars and have owned a couple others that I sold.

If your Godin guitar works for you when you get it (mine always have) you're fine. If you need help or a response fogetaboudit. You'll never hear from them.

"I was first acquainted with the Mitchell MD100s at Guitar Center when I went in search for an inexpensive acoustic guitar that sounded decent. I tested various entry-level guitars from some of the more prominent makers including, however, most of them were fully laminate and if they featured any solid-tops the lack of quality did not justify the price. Finally, I tried the MD-100s, which features a solid top (with laminate back and sides) for a price comparable to the all-laminate entry-level guitars. It didn't take much playing time before I realized that this was the right guitar for me.

The tone and playability of the instrument surpassed most offerings in the entry-level category and the tone compared to intermediate-level guitars with price ranges near $500. Moreover, the guitar does not look like something at the entry-level price point. The solid-top looks great and is enhanced with abalone rosette. Fortunately for me, I found the guitar on sale through craigslist for roughly $60 and never made the purchase full price. As other reviewers have mentioned, if you can get this guitar through craigslist or an auction, they often sell for under $100 and are very easy to come by.

Despite my overall satisfaction, this guitar does not come without caveats. Because it is a mass produced instrument, it is not always properly adjusted and may require that you make few adjustments to the neck to resolve fret-buzz. Moreover, the bridge pins, saddle, and nut are all cheap plastic. Replacing these cheap plastic parts with wood-pins and faux-ivory saddle and nut will increase the tone quality and make the instrument that much better. Lastly, I removed the plain-black pickguard and replaced it with a tortoise pickguard. This was a purely aesthetic decision. I think it looks awesome.",4.0

"Swayed by the positive reviews here at amazon and Roland's suggestion that this is the one do-it-all amp for playing in smaller spaces, I purchased this for home use with my Korg Kronos. This amp can't handle about 75% of what I am playing, which is mostly electric piano and drum accompaniments played at reasonable volumes. The whole unit vibrates and distorts easily when I play lower octaves. What's more, the sound comes across as canned, or trapped inside the physical dimensions of the box. Listening through my headphones and then through this, I can't believe that I am playing the same instrument. I believe these issues to be inexcusable, particularly during low-volume playing. I don't know whether the unit is faulty, or whether it's just a lightweight. Either way, I will probably give it away to some guitarist looking for more of a busking set up. This definitely can't cut it for the Kronos or, I would guess, for any keyboard whose player wants to hear the quality sounds that their instrument is capable of.",2.0

"The tech who recommended this pickup installs them on his Martins (he has some nice ones).  I installed this on a handmade OM style guitar, and it sounds as good as any other pickup I currently use (Taylor ES-2 & L.R. Baggs).

On the plus side, do not let the price fool you.  You get quite a bit of performance for $99.  Also, you can do this yourself if you are not afraid to carefully drill out the hole where your current endpin is sitting.  I would however recommend that you take your time - it's not a 5-minute install.  Finally, it is not an invasive system.  You do not have to cut and add to the structure of your guitar.  It requires no batteries, and you drill one hole and glue the pickups in place.

The only reason why I gave this only (4) starts is that I have never found an acoustic guitar pickup that really impressed me.  A high-end condenser mike impresses me, but acoustic guitar pickups do not. But this is the most solid (4) I could give any acoustic pickup.",4.0

"I am an intermediate level piano player, and I am used to using an acoustic Yamaha upright. As a practice piano, the np-30 gets a 3 because learning fast songs is different and harder than on the 'real thing,' but it has decent sounds and sensitivity and it is portable (I believe it's the smallest and lightest 76-key keyboard). So while I'm disappointed having bought into the 'hype,' I still enjoy using it all the time. Here are some differences that you should know if you, like me, want to learn to play with fast hands:
--Key spacing: the keys are 3/4"" smaller than an acoustic, over the whole keyboard. There are also noticeable gaps in between each one. I would sometimes get my fingers ""caught"" in the space and so unintentionally play extra notes when moving my hand back and forth quickly.
--Slippery keys: The plastic is the same as any keyboard, so it is more difficult to grip than an acoustic's. The black keys are a little thinner and more rounded than an acoustic's square-ish ones. Make sure your fingers are curled on difficult passages to limit the slippage.
--Key sensitivity: I don't think the dynamics are as broad as an acoustics. The lightest touch that would work on an acoustic sometimes doesn't make a sound. The back part of the keys is more rigid, making playing loud chords using weaker fingers harder. Turning touch sensitivity down helps, but limits the range.

Overall, I still think this keyboard was the right choice for me since I really value portability. Others may want to either get the casio wk110 which is similar but cheaper, or a p85 or px-130 for a more tactile feel.",3.0

It looks like the day I bought it even though I play it at least a few hours per week. I get together a few times a year with some musician friends of mine. They've all given her a play and she has impressed them all. A couple of jaw drops the first time playing her. Now they fight over using it when we get together.

The case is excellent. Very rugged with support for the neck and two actually useful pockets. It is the best guitar case I have actually.

My students love it and are having great success!  I highly recommend Jamstik!",5.0
Perfect for the smaller venues that we have to play in these days.  Did some work on the bass drum and it sounds pretty good considering its size.  I'll put a mic on it to help it out a bit.  The toms sound great and I'm looking forward to the first gig with the kit in a couple of weeks.,4.0

"These are high quality plugs for use with the Lava Mini ELC Solder-Free Cable system.

"Got  FATSO a few hours ago.. 1st impressions was louder, high freq's a little brittle and NO noise.  If you look up ""Best guitar cable""  most likely I own most all somewhere's in the top 10. My Amp is a low powered class A. Not alot in the path of the signal. Guitar is a Casino Coupe ( great guitar for blues..thats all I play) Amp is Kustom Defender head in the  4 watt position to an 18 ohms Eminence LADY LUCK.speaker. The Fatso being noiseless is a big deal for me, I busk with demo's and early post war electric tunes.  I bought 2 electric strips that is a regulated power going to whats plugged it  . (it really made a difference in many ways.. its a good purchase,) but in any event The Fatso eliminated the pain in the butt ""noise"" ..  Also louder then Mogami but not as transparent. I've tried all my cables against the Fatso (15 feet).  I have ear fatigue now and decided to stop and give my ears a rest for awhile,
  But with all that said one thing I do know for sure..They sure are better then the run of the mill cables.. no contest .. I've cut into some with the idea of making short patch chords and found there's not much braid and very thin center lead..not worth it.. I will add some more info as the ""break in""?)

"Convenient to plug into a phone as a mic pack, but the audio is a bit muffled. It works fine in a pinch or if you need to utilize your phone for recording on the go, but there are better lapel mics available that are for the same purpose.",3.0
"I check this listing every now and then, and the one-star review from a person who acknowledges that they've never even used this item has always bugged me.  I've been using this board for about a year and a half and thought I'd give it the treatment it deserves.

First off- cosmetics and durability: This thing is RUGGED.  If you're a fan of the brushed-aluminum aesthetic prominent in Apple's design philosophy you will love how this unit looks and feels. If you've ever lusted over the wood trim on a Moog Voyager or Moogerfooger you'll like that, too.  As with the Moog gear, the wooden rails on this board can be removed if you want to install it into a desk or custom rack.  The screen leaves a bit to be desired- especially in this era of touch-screen devices and retina displays, but navigation is intuitive and effective.  I am the 2nd owner of my board, and it came with a few lines across the top the screen.  They don't inhibit my ability to read the menus, but they do diminish the attractiveness of what is already a somewhat bland display.  Reportedly, replacement screens run $200.  2Seemy also makes a mod for this board that enables you to hook up an outboard VGA display, which I think would be a wise investment for long-term use.

Versatility- where to begin?  Firsly, a lot of younger people might not realized that this board was not designed specifically to hook up to a computer.  All of the functionality described in its promotional literature is stuff you can do regardless of the medium to which you are recording- ADAT, 2"" tape, cassette, CD-R, minidisc, direct to mp3, you name it.  This is an ""out-of-the-box"" board, with extensive digital integration.  The automation section is straight forward and easy to get your head around, even for someone like me who learned in a PC-DAW environment.  The digital routing is impressive, to say the least.  Take a good look at a picture of the back of this board- now realize that ANY input can be routed to ANY output, including any inputs and outputs that you might add via one of the 4 expansion bays. This means you can essentially set up all of your equipment, and not have to re-wire your studio every time you want to do something differently, it's essentially a big digital patch bay.  Which brings me to my next point-

DAW Integration.  It's 2013, so chances are anybody reading this review will be wondering how well it works with their DAW as a controller and/or interface.  I added the IF-FW/DMMKii Firewire card and have used this primarily with Cubase 7, on both Windows and Mac.  Setup was fairly straight forward, especially on the Mac (Windows took longer mostly due to my unfamiliarity with Windows at the time).  The Tascam documentation provided most of the information necessary to get me up and running, and I was able to easily fill in the blanks by extrapolation or performing a quick forum search.  I've also recently started playing around with Logic X, and setup was instantaneous- Logic detected my board, and did all of the configuration for me.  It is worth noting that Tascam is still actively supporting this product, and already has a driver available for OS X 10.9 Mavericks (which, as of this writing, has not been publicly released).

I mentioned above how any input can be mapped to any output?  This also holds true for the ""virtual"" inputs and outputs in your DAW.  You can map any existing track back into the board in order to make use of the TC|Works effects or Tascam preamps, or you can route them straight out of the board and back in to make use of any external effects, outboard gear, etc.  If you want, you can even route your entire project through the board and do your mixing 100% out-of-the-box, using the computer as if it were a tape machine.  You have a total of 64 tracks over FireWire (32 in, 32 out) to work with, which should be plenty for anyone searching out a board in this price range.

As a DAW-controller:  It was my search for a DAW controller that brought me to this product.  Put simply- there is nothing else in its class.  You could buy three Mackie 8-fader banks for the same price, and be left with a cluttered desk and still no interface or preamps.  You could buy a Behringer X32 and be embarrassed any time you had somebody over to record.  Or you could spend twice as much JUST for a nice control surface, and still have to worry about your actual audio interface.  For my needs the DM-4800 was a no-brainer.  Faders respond to my Cubase automation flawlessly, Cubase records my Tascam automation flawlessly, there's really not much else to say here.  It's a nice touch(no pun intended) that simply tapping a fader will select that track in my DAW.  In my 3-display setup this enables me to instantaneously view my live-spectograph, EQ, and channel strip for any track I want instantaneously, without having to reach for my mouse or scroll through my project.  There's no telling how much time this single feature has saved me, but I'm guessing it could be measured in ""hours per month"".

Now the preamps:  A+, Tascam.  Seriously.  The trim pots give you up to 56dB of gain, and with a good mic I can get well into the 40s before I start hearing a discernible increase in the noise floor.  They don't seem to add or remove any particular quality to the sound, they just do what they need to do and they do it well.  You can select between Mic and Line inputs, with an optional -20dB cut on the mic, and the +48V Phantom Power is switchable in banks of 4.  In a studio with several contemporary Neve and vintage Sunn preamps, the Tascams hold their own.  In comparison with the Presonus and ART pres that I've also used, the Tascam has essentially ejected them from my work flow.

I could write a lot more, I could probably sit here writing for hours just as I could sit and talk your ear off all night about it.  The truth is, this board does way more than what I've been able to do with it, it does way more than I even understand.  There are buttons I still haven't pressed, and no doubt features that I've yet to discover.  Point being- after a year and a half on this board my enthusiasm is the same as it was the day I bought it, and shows no signs of waning.",5.0
"We have been shopping a while for commercial window lights and we finally decided on these for our business windows.  We liked that they are LED, easy to install with 3M tape, and that they are controlled with remote.  We bought 3 of the 50 foot packages (150 feet total).  They were easy to install and overall they came out fantastic!  Very white and bright.  We love the different functions on the remote.

"I recently purchased this clarinet in the pink color and it works great. It is a very good buy and contains everything you need if your first starting out. The reeds worked fine and they weren't dried out. The cork grease was very helpful.

"This is a great little delay pedal. It has a great sound and enough flexibility for pretty much anything you would need it for. It is well built and should last a long time. I have run it into a few different amps and for me, it seems to only work in an amp with effects loop. If put in front of the amp, it hums like no other. This is on amps with effects loops so maybe it works differently on amps without it. I've not looked to see if it is only recommended for effect loop use so that may play into it as well. I just know it sounds fantastic through my amps effects loops. Would highly recommend",5.0

"Swiss Army knife amp that comes in handy for lots of situations.

"This is a good tuner; for many years, in the absence of a piano or keyboard near by, I've tuned my violin to my ear. Once I get once string tuned to a pitch, I can get the other 3 with ease. Of course, this method is only useful when I play alone. Recently, I've been playing with others and have to be tuned to standards. That's where this little tuner comes in.

It's pretty small and light; you don't have to worry about having it on your violin. It has nice grips and it will not scratch your instrument. The head swivels, so you can position it in the direction that best works for you. I remove it from the violin once I'm done tuning but you can certainly leave it there if you want to use it for intonation practicing or you want to use the metronome feature.

The display has colors to help you tune.. from red, yello, to green when finally tuned. It will also tell you if you are off and by how much which I find helpful, especially since I do not have fine tuners on all my strings.

I'm satisfied with the purchase.",5.0

"My issue is not with the product.  It is a 5 star product.  I just wish it was in a better package or had a power pass thru.  Anyway the product is AMAZING.  You have no idea how crappy your music sounds until you try this.  Voices sound real.  Bells and cymbals sound , well like they are suppose to.  You can hear the fingers on the guitar strings.  Voices in the back ground, that you might not have heard before.  Now for me even the  basic music sounds a bit better.  HD tracks are the way to go.  Not the crap they uprezed.  The real HD tracks do your research.  Now if you have crappy headphones I can guarantee you will not hear a difference.  Buy good ear buds FIRST.  Then this.  It works seamlessly with android.  Just plug it in.  Sometimes you will get the robot sounds where the music is not getting processed properly.  Just unplug and replug.  I used this on Klipsh headsets and ear buds.  And pumped it into my stereo and it sounds great.  Even my tone deaf daughter can hear it.  She likes the piano better thru this device.

Update the micro USB to Micro USB cable bent on me.  Gets back to my desire for a better package.  STD usb output is stronger I would prefer a larger package with a stronger connector.  You have to have this thing hanging off you device anyway what is an extra 1/8 of an inch.  The company CTO contacted me via email.  I requested a place to get a cable online.  USB micro to Micro are mostly power only no data.  I have purchased 3.  What did work is an OTG usb keyboard cable, that is Micro usb female to USB male.  Geez now I have more cables hanging off my phone.  However that being said I love to hear Music that sounds like music.  So I still love the device, HATE the package.  Also seems to work with my Nexus 7 tab fine.  S6 all I get is robot sounds.  I also have not received a replacement cable.",1.0

"This small recorder is just amazing in how many features it has and the sound quality, even when just wearing headphones to monitor your progress -- is incredibly rich. The folks who commented on the ""over complexity"" of it are right and I get what they mean now. However, it's just really a matter of sitting down with the instruction manual and crunching through all of the steps. It's a little intimidating at first, but like riding a bicycle, you'll pick it up pretty fast -- and you'll be using it with ease sooner than you think. Like many of you, I still have my beloved Tascam 4 track TAPE recorder and I used that one for years and years, with outstanding ""non hiss"" quality recordings that I still have and listen to. I'm an old horse, and it was a while before I was convinced about digital recorders. I'm stunned by this DP-008EX. Recording and over-dubbing your tracks is super easy after a few tries. I've got it propped up on a small shelf by my desk and amplifier so that it's easier to see and work with. It looks so very nice. I was originally going to be cheap and get the previous model (six track) to save money -- but THIS ONE has the lighted display screen and looks so cool. I'm very pleased. What put me over the top to actually buy this one? As is many times the case, it was the musicians and home enthusiasts here who took the time to write out those superb and detailed reviews. Thank you all, OK? This machine is a blast and sounds incredible for the price. *** My only complaint is that they don't make it clear that the adapter in NOT included and I ordered this recorder without one and had to play with batteries for a while. No big deal, but they should make that more clear to people, I think. I later ordered the recommended adapter shown below on the product page, and that's the one you want. I'm good now. ***",5.0

"I wanted an instrument with a little more volume than a standard tenor ukulele.  Also, I like the sound of the tiple as played by radio star Arthur Godfrey.  This instrument duplicates that sound and MORE than satisfies.  It has a wonderful harp-like quality, sort of similar to a 12-string guitar.  I find myself easily playing -and sounding great- on mandolin tunes.  The sound is sweet and mellow, but satisfies with a volume that stands out acoustically.  Of course plugged in to a good amp or PA board, there's as much volume as you'll ever need with the built in Barcus-Berry pickup system.  Overall i'm very satisfied.  I also purchased the Gator ""Pro Go Series G-PG-UKE-TEN Gig Bag for Tenor Style Ukulele/A/F Style Mandolin"" case.
Had I realized the OU28TE was available WITH CASE for not much more money, I likely would've gone with that.  Still, I'm extremely satisfied with the instrument, and find the Gator case fits perfectly, with good protection and pro appearance.  I will caution purchasers to be patient with tuning the uke.  The nylon strings especially take a while to stretch and settle into their proper tuning.  It may at first seem the tuners are faulty, but just keep cranking on the tuners, be patient and keep re-tuning!  It will be worth the wait! I highly recommend this instrument!  I am in my seventies and have played professionally for at least 50 of those years.",5.0

"Love a good deal? I do. You will too with this set of four mics and power head. Two are belt pack mics, thus eliminating the need to hang on to them.

There is sound difference between the headset and handhelds. The handhelds are more for singing and louder voice projection. The headsets work better with normal speaking voice and do not respond well to singing without becoming distorted.

I wear a headset since I am basically commentating, and for this purpose it does the job and I have the other for back-up. I allow guests to use the handhelds since their not as finicky, and people seem to like holding them. More of a mood enhancer.

Volume is controlled at the head with individual settings and can be balanced with mix output as well.

This is versatile with good components and priced fairly. I would invest in extra batteries. Handhelds are great, headsets, not so much.",5.0

"SOUND -

Flat frequency response without being entirely lifeless. Clear instrument separation regardless of the relatively minuscule soundstage compared to other open headphones. Again, very flat frequency response and good for mixing - though actual accuracy is a tad underwhelming. For actually listening, the mids are a tad too powerful by comparison to the low end for my taste - and I am by no means a basshead - but it can lead to some over-sibilant vocals and harsh cymbals overtaking the high end. It would be inappropriate to say that they're not top of the line for the price you pay though, as I'm truly nitpicking and wouldn't have expected them to sound any better.

BUILD -

Well, they're certainly lightweight. This comes at a cost though, as they're flimsy and cheaply constructed. Again, not unexpected for the price paid and honestly I'd rather have better sound than build at this price point. If you expect to really beat them up though, they'll most likely not appreciate it from a structural standpoint.

VALUE -

Great, but not exceptional. You'd be hard pressed to find something better under $100, but there are certainly better headphones for listening and even mixing at a slightly less tight budget.",5.0
"This is a great little system for point-to-point digital transmission of audio.  I haven't made any measurements yet (clipping levels, noise floor, etc.) but my first impression is that the sound quality is pretty good ... certainly better than FM stereo, and certainly better than low-bitrate compressed audio (like low bitrate MP3 files).  I haven't tried the USB transmitter yet, as I didn't really need that function; if I try it later I'll update the review.

My one disappointment is that the transmitter can only send mic level signals in mono.  I had hoped to plug in a stereo mic and transmit stereo back to the receiver, but it cannot do that.  However it can transmit line level signals in stereo.

I would have given this system five stars except for two issues.  One is the lack of stereo mic capability as mentioned above.  The other is the limited run time from the internal battery.  I'd like to be able to set this up in advance of a concert or other performance (while the room is empty), have it stay on until the performance begins and then finishes, and safely record the event.  The battery run time is marginal for that, so I'd be afraid the system would power down before the performance ends.  I'd much rather have a device that's 1/4"" wider or 1/2"" longer with an 8-hour run time.  The limited run time, and lack of stereo mic capability, puts this firmly in the ""amateur"" league, so I gave it only four stars, despite the good audio quality.",4.0

"I have not had any of the noise issues that others have mentioned. Construction is great, and i love the simple operation. I have not tried the toneprint, but i have used that with a TC head and I'm sure i will get around to it at some point. The stock compressor on the head  (which is identical to this), always seemed to work the best anyway.  This does not come with a power supply, nor can it run on a battery. I use the 1-spot for all of my pedals and it works fine with this too. My only complaint is that this squashes the low frequencies too much-regardless of the settings. My EH Bass Preacher is a far better pedal for less money and it does not negatively affect low-end (which is odd since the point of the Spectracomp is to avoid that??).",3.0

I have a recording studio and am always trying to achieve the best sound.
When I found this unit and read the reviews, I decided to take a chance.
Wow.  It works. There is a new clarity to the music that just draws you in.  I am loving it.
I must add that if you have speaker wire that looks something like lamp cord, you will never achieve good sound.  It must be a jacketed & twisted pair configuration. It has to do with capacitance and slew rate.. but that's another story.
If you have a nice audio system and you're looking for that added improvement, it's a small price to pay.  enjoy!",5.0

"I've had a few violins over the years and wanted to get back to trying to hack my way thru some tunes... I bought this one cuz I'm broke and forty bucks is crazy cheap.  First the good...
The case is really nice. Its probably what your paying for. It has two shoulder straps to go along with it. Great for the price...
The not so good. ..
The bow for starters is kinda crappy. Even with the tension screw backed all the way off its still at full tension. Not great considering it wants to bounce when u play.  I took it apart and it looks like the slot wasn't routed far enough to allow proper adjustment.
The violin itself is pretty from a couple feet away but in your hands its another story. The varnish has runs in it. Big runs that are pretty ugly. The fingerboard on mine actually has space under it on the nut side of the e string. Maybe a four year old was on the glue line the day they made mine... the ""purfling"" is painted on and the lines don't even touch. The neck is supposed to be natural but there's a big brown fingerprint of the body stain right in the middle of it under the clear coat. The fingerboard is pearwood or something which I knew when I bought it but it must have been kicked around the shop floor before they picked it up and glued it onto this violin. Big gouges and some saw marks still visible. The body has nicks and gouges in it that they just finished right over. It might have taken 3 minutes to sand them out but apparently that's too much time to waste when your stamping out a million of these a day...
All in all its a fiddle. It cost me forty bucks so my expectations weren't that high but it could have been better. Maybe fifteen minutes of detail work and this would have been a superb looking instrument. Sound is fine. Little high on the action but I can fix that.
Whatever... it got me playing again for cheap. If that's what your after then buy it. Just don't get your hopes up for it to look like anything worth having...",1.0

"I use this with a 5150 block letter head...so all opinion will be based on that application..
Pedal is used primarily as a boost..it has two functions...gain boost and mid boost..mid boost has a mini switch that allows for low/mid/high band mid boost. 3 knobs..gain..mid boost..and mid q...gain for normal boost....gain for mid..and mid q that controls mid boost mix...mini switch selects the frequency band that is mid boosted. On/off switch is unique in that it not only turns on and off but also when holding it it selects between the standard boost and mid boost.
It adds a good amount of gain, but it is a sweet and musical gain..not harsh and doesn't change the character of your amp..it just pushes it to that next level.. The 3 different mid bands all give a different voice...nice low mid chunk...creamy mid and upper mid bite respectively...The 5150 is a great amp, but pre gain settings above 5.5 lose definition and tend to fuzz out...this pedal also made the rhythm channel useable...really tightens it up and using your volume knob on the guitar in conjunction gives so much more control of the amp....using it on the lead channel requires a bit of touch as the combined gain can get a bit hairy..some work to find the sweet spots are well worth it...it really makes this amp sing. I can't see how this pedal wouldn't make any user extremely happy. It isn't cheap at $200, but for the tonal nirvana this pedal provides...as well as being solidly built with a pedal board friendly size...then throw in American made and you just can't go wrong.",5.0

"I purchased the MOTU UltraLite-MK3 Hybrid due to the added USB2 port and my need for more inputs and outputs.

It's already past 30 days so I cannot return the unit (I unfortunately only discovered the broken USB functionality recently) and MOTU technical support is impossible to get to.  The Phone Technical Support line is always busy and if you call the Customer Support line (which is separate), they tell you essentially to wait your turn (meaning busy signals for hours and no contact).

"I bought this guitar for my lefty son after he was inspired by a Tommy Emmanuel video.  The first guitar came and I was quite impressed.  The feel was very solid, frets were smooth and no sharp edges.  I also own Yamaha 'Junior' for my right handed kids and this sounds much better than that.  Where the Yamaha has a ukelele sound, this has a small sound, but that of a real guitar.  The sound was small, but not like the $30 junk guitars you see at department stores.

Also, the components are much better, the guitar is heavier, and the bridge is 'compensated.  Overall very nice.

BUT...the guitar stand I had it on got knocked over and the headstock snapped when it hit the hardwood floor.

So while the first guitar was great, the (first) replacement was horrible.  Unfinished frets that just GRIND when the strings are bent, fret ends sharp and will take the skin off of young hands.  Top strings hit frets when played and thus have a 'twangy' tone (I know, this is not the best description.  Less than 'buzzing', but definitely not a clean, clear tone like the first guitar).  The action is too high (from the bridge / saddle being too high), this, coupled with  the bridge / string peg placement far closer than on the first guitar, resulted in the bass strings have a very acute angle from peg to bridge.

If this had been the first guitar, I would have sent it back and NOT ordered a replacement.

However, since I know they CAN make and finish a good guitar, I returned the second and got the third, which is kind of in the middle.  Sharp, grindy frets, poor bridge placement again and generally poor finish work on the fredboard and finish.

I suppose if Amazon is willing to send another replacement, I can try once more, but I'm an quickly getting tired of the exchange game.

I would rate the first guitar 4 stars, the second 1 star, and the third 2-1/2 stars.

It would be nice if they only sold guitars inspected by 'Q.C. HK1'  The person who inspected the first guitar.  The last two had Q.C. HK2 on them and have been far less than stellar!",3.0

I purchased this to use to play scales in key. The pads require a very firm push. After an hour my hand was killing me. As a clip launcher it may be great but as an alternate keyboard- forget it. I also purchased the J74 Iso controller software which allows this to be used with any DAW. The J74 software did work up to a point; triggering both Cubase and Logic without any latency - but the scales in key mode was nothing like the youtube video showed it to be.,1.0

"been using computers for 9 years now. Always been willing to learn, study, read the manuals, etc, but truth is, whenever I try, I feel dreadful, as if I have to bust my butt just to understand how to do stupid basic things, like quantize, overdub etc.

Felt like that for 9 years. And I really tried. Manuals always suck, feels like you have to prepare to pilot a spaceship before you learn how to do stupid basic things like overdub, loop, export to a specific format, etc.  You'd think you just need to search in the index, type 'overdub' and read how to do it, yes? Well, think again. A zillion times I typed common technical terms like 'punch in' , 'overdub' etc, only to have the goddamn 'manual' return the search with ZERO results. So what you do? You start reading random stuff. Before long, you even forget what the heck it was you wanted to do, losing your focus. This never happened with standalone digital multitrackers.

Hey, in the end, it's understandable: these programs were NEVER written by musicians, they were always written by computer nerds.

Always hated the program, always will. Overrated, overpriced and just a nonsensical and anti-musical learning curve.",1.0

"5 stars because looks solid, heavy, and beautiful and is the best Yamaha sustain pedal.
Doesn't work on my PSRe-313.  A little research showed that it works with only a few portable grands, most P- models, and a few others.  The rest of us need the FC4(similar design) or FC5(cheapest, just on/off sustain) . Look in your owner's manual or go to yamaha.com and find your model, then look under ""Assessories"" to see what sustain pedals are compatible with your keyboard.  Probably not compatible with any non-Yamaha keyboard.",5.0

For the amount of money I spent ... I thought these would blow me away. They are just okay. Certainly have heard worse. The buds need to be firmly placed in you ears or the sound quality will suffer. I am a working musician (keyboards) and I use one of these buds in just one of my ears in live gig situations. I still use a powered wedge to monitor myself and allow the band to hear me ... but with a bud in one ear I do not have to play as loud on stage. As long as the bud is tightly placed in my ear ... it gives me the presence I would usually miss with just a wedge on stage at a low volume.,3.0

They come in a retail packaging that's not typical of most LED strips.  Most come in a ziploc type bag but these were the plastic shelled version that gave you visibility as well at protection.  These strips are SMD 5050's so they provide more light than the SMD 3228's.  If you don't need the brightness, you can save some money by going with the 3528 strips.

I tested all 5 strips by hooking them to an RGB controller.  All 5 worked flawlessly and produced a beautiful array of colors.  Please ignore the negative reviews from people because they didn't read the description or do any ""homework"" on LEDs.  It's not the vendor fault you didn't order everything you need.  It's like me buying light bulbs and expecting it to come with sockets and power.

This item is price very competitively and best of all, it's from a US seller so you get it within a few days, with Prime.  The controller can be had for less than $3 if you're willing to wait for a China distributor.  If not, it's about $10.  For power, any 5mm 12v power source will do and you might have some lying around because it's a common adapter.  If you don't, one can be had for about $7.  I would recommend going with a 2 amp version (search Amazon ""12v 2amp adapter"").  I've attached a video of 2 strips strung together on my Christmas tree so you can see what you're getting.",5.0

"This is a great product on the surface but should have been better tested before release.

Being able to control outlets 3-8 is a great feature, and it has great energy monitoring features. The naming of outlets et. al is great!

I love the feature that the unit will ping a host connected to its ports to see if its really off or on.

The command line interface ensures that external scripts or gui's can be created to quickly control outlets.

-HOWEVER-

The following bugs crop up and have not been fixed after multiple days of support contact:

1. When setting the website name under Configuration and Control > Contact information > Website, If the length of the site is filled past 16 characters (even though the form allows 23), an error message states the name was entered incorrectly. At one point during this, all the ports powered on by themselves even though I left the outlet power on page! This is a bug that could potentially halt entire racks due to rapid power drain tripping an external breaker as all connected devices come up simultaneously (I assume if outlet delay is configured, they would come up according to their defined delay.) I have been able to reproduce this only a few times.
****************

When logging in via ssh, an incorrect password entered results in a non-standard disconnect error in Putty and Teraterm. Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (instead of incorrect password entered). Similar behavior happens in Linux CLI with unreadable garbage returned and user being kicked out. A cleaner example follows:
EXAMPLE:
root@AGSAS-Cent-VM09: ssh apc@192.168.2.83 (entering wrong password)
> Error:buffer_get_ret: trying to get more bytes 4 than in buffer 0
> buffer_get_int: buffer error
TERATERM: The server doesn't have valid authentication method (showing bad ssh login coding)
Normal behavior is a credential re-prompt.

> When in the web GUI, incorrect login credentials results in proper behavior, so that is OK.
****************

Trying to ssh into the host takes two tries (the first attempt seems to wake up the CLI Responder after not accessing it for a while)
****************

Sometimes entering CLI commands EXACTLY as they should be entered, with perfect syntax and formatting, results in ""Paramater Error"". Log out and paste back in the same command, and it magically works like it should. Turning an outlet off then trying to turn it back on using olOff command successfully, trying to turn it on again gives error.

This seems to happen when using the ""olOn all"" type commands when one outlet is already on/off. The system seems to get confused because it is trying to turn on/off an outlet that already is:

Administrator@apc>olstatus all
E000: Success
Outlet #1&2, Infrastructure: On

"I decided to purchase this little amplifier to create a volume control for my earphones directly connected to my DVD player.  I use the earphones to listen to DVDs while I exercise and the only way I could get the volume high enough in the past was to use full size headphones that included a built-in amplifier or use a full-size stereo amplifier (it's being used elsewhere).

So... I was looking for amplified earphones and found the Behringer Headphone Amp at a price considerably less than the cost of a good pair of earphones.  And I already had multiple sets of earphone that I could use.

The result is exactly as I hoped.  I can use my existing earphones and control the audio volume of the DVD.  It was necessary to add a few adapters because these 1/4"" plugs are larger than my input or output, but that's not a surprise. Sound quality is very acceptable.

If you are going to do something similar, perhaps attaching this to independently control the volume of multiple sets of headphones or earphones for a TV, just make sure you buy or have the right adapters or cables.  Installation is quite straight forward.  Hope this helps.",5.0

"Good, but a couple of gotcha's:

They are shorter than regular springs such as the black floyd noiseless. Usually this isn't an issue, but it can be disasterous if you have a trem with a tall (37mm or 42mm) block and you do extreme pull-ups.  In this configuration, the short springs can run out of travel, causing them to fall right off because they are no longer under tension!

The instructions that come with these need to say that you need to bare the ends of the springs to allow the shield circuit to work normally.

Other than that, they're great.",3.0

If your a single act this is the way to go. 2 suggestions. I do a lot of looping as I beat box to accompany my acoustic guitar. Buy a separate pedal switch. Why you ask? Well to get out of the loop program to change guitar or vocal effects you have to hold down the loop switch for a second which also operates the effects. Yes you could remap your switches but I need every other switch just how it is set up. Second thing. BEFORE you say its way to complicated to get you best harmonies press the vocal button and go to hard tune. Pitch and tone corrector. It needs to be set differently for different voices. Natural hard tune does not work as well for me. I even change it for different songs I do. Is it complicated. Well yes but if you purchase it from Sweet Water they have Excellent Tech support.,5.0

"As someone who is very new to ocarinas I can't really be taken as the final word on the quality of any instrument, but I can tell you that I am very impressed with this one.  The ocarina itself is beautiful and feels sturdy (not like the ones you find at festivals), and the scale is spot on (checked with a tuner).

From what I gather, it can be difficult to hit the highest notes on some ocarinas, and while it does seem to be a bit finer of a task than the low notes, I have had no trouble doing it on this one.

The padded case that came with the ocarina is far better than what I had anticipated and I'm very pleased with the purchase.

Some quick info:
The shipping was spectacularly quick and the ocarina itself was very well padded (the box was about the size of a shoe-box and mostly packing peanuts)

If you go to the focolink website, it's my understanding that there are two ""shapes"" that this ocarina comes in and I believe this is the ""B"" shape (a bit thinner).  I had no preference, and I'm still not entirely sure that I'm correct on that, but I do mention it in case someone is wondering.",5.0
"When I got a Hofner Violin Bass and tried to restring, the strings wouldn't fit, because they were long scale. And I read that short scale strings will not fit a hofner violin bass, because even though it is a short scale bass, the design of the bass itself makes it so short scale strings do not fit properly. Thank god I read that, because these are amazing strings and they fit perfectly!

The sound that these strings give you is amazing and if you are looking for that Paul McCartney sound this is great, but I don't know if it's the best for that as I didn't use any other kind of string for now.

I'll be buying these strings only for now on! D'addario strings will always be the best in my opinion.",5.0

"I have more expensive pitch pipes for the violin.  Sometimes it is a bit difficult to get the note tuned to match the pipe.  I was tired of repeating the process of blowing the pitch pipe and tuning the string to match it.  It always took many times.  The Snark allowed easy tuning.  Tuning takes less than half the time than it did with the pitch pipe.  Unit seems solid, as long as you do not stress the meter on its neck.  My son played notes on the violin and then mimicked the note with a hum.  Putting the Snark to his neck, the Snark still read the note and it matched that of the violin.

"This is my favorite harmonica out of the 10 I own.  It growls, and has a lot of bass.  It's great for getting practice on the top octave, since that isn't squeaky like all other harmonicas.

"It looks as good as on the picture, is made specifically for the Nexus 10.  The keyboard takes some getting used to, but what can you expect, it is a very compact keyboard.  My wife uses it all the time, as well as the stand in the back to prop up the tablet.  Pairing was straightforward with the instructions.  I'm really jealous that I still have to use my big heavy laptop.  The case provides perfect protection, another thing my wife was looking for.  Can't beat the price I think.  I hope it'll last for a while.

I ordered before Christmas and was promised it to be shipped between 12/24 and 12/28.  I emailed and they told me it would be the following Friday.  It actually shipped a week later.  So their estimation of when things ship could improve, but Christmas time is always hectic and I'm sure there was a lot of demand for the item.  WELL WORTH THE WAIT THOUGH.

"My first purchase was a $40 shotgun mic, and combined with a Canon 70d there was a constant static or hiss in my audio. I later learned that any mic combined with the Canons onboard recorder will not have a clean, noise free background.

Somehow I found the Shure VP83f on Amazon and I liked how it combined a recorder and mic in one unit, rather than mounting a H1 and a seperate mic on my camera.

Pros:
  -very high quality construction, aluminum body
  -compact, professional look
  -lcd screen readout
  -durable suspension- no more replacing bands
  -clean audio with the onboard recorder, more hissy recording thru Canon 70d
  -headphone output- a must have, since this mic is very sensitive and will pick up alot of unforseen audio.
  -uses 2 common aa batteries- I use eneloop rechargables. Lasts more than 10 hr recording.
  -high gain of 60db max
  -not a very high learning curve

Cons:
  -weight. With eneloop batteries, total weight is 10 ounces or 282 grams.
  -screen is really small and can be hard to read at times, but it is backlighted
  -no usb out. micro sd card has to be removed and put in a card reader on your computer

I know, the price is high, but this is the only all-in-one like this. Rode has mentioned a similar unit awhile ago, but it has not surfaced yet. I have not regretted purchasing this and know it will serve me well.",5.0

"I have over 15 years playing experience and I would not have any other strings on my guitar.

I have messed around with many different brands and even the $1/pack I found online (which I wanted to change half way through a set) but there is simply nothing else out there at this price which lasts as long, sounds as good and makes playing such a pleasure as these.

I play mostly acoustic guitar in a one man show and play anywhere from 2-5 hours, though the average is around 3 hours. I finger pick but mostly strum with medium thickness picks. I tune frequently to open chords and there never is a problem.

I never leave home without a few packs in my case in case a string breaks, but I rarely need them until I decide to change all my strings. They last a long time and never seem to loose their vibrant sound.",5.0

"I was reffered to these by a friend- He's a much bigger music guru than myself so I took his word for it. I should have looked at the comments first- There's quite a few other reviews that state the G string doesn't last- They weren't kidding. I literally got it all strung up and tuned, played a few cords and it broke.

My buddy we got these same strings a month ago said his G string broke on up within two weeks. I'm not sure how they're making one particular string worse than the others- But I'm simply impressed. (Sarcasm) Now I have the task of hunting down a single G string somewhere, which is a shame I usually like to keep them all one brand.

Other then that, the sound is pretty decent- but if the durability on these doesn't hold up I'm likely to not go with this brand anymore.",3.0

I can tell that there are some minor quality issues with the wood, and the tipper is a bit big, but this is a really affordable drum, so I didn't expect too much.

"As we all know, Audio Mixers are as varied as we people are. We also are oh, so partial to our own specific likings on an audio mixer. This is an overview of my new ""12 Channel"" PreSonus AR12 USB.

I quote the ""12 Channel"" part of the title because It's really a nine channel audio mixer to me and from what I've tried, thus far, it's one pretty cool all-in-one machine, especially for Livestreaming. But as all mixers go, it's not without its quirks and oddities.

This sure is a compact, pretty sleek look'n device that will fit right in with my home-made Livestreaming rig. Unit. The well-placed buttons are easy to navigate and the sliders (although a little plastic-y) feel smooth and have plenty of travel for minute adjustments.

First, let's talk about the obvious features... It's got a USB connection, to output to Livestream units for DAW thoroughput, that sounds real clean to my ears. This has not been my experience with other mixers and analog-to-digital converters. Although there still is a small latency, it's probably one of the least noticeable.

Next feature is the FX generator, for the once-in-a-while singing speaker on stage, that really sounds better with a tiny bit of reverb. Sounds pretty clean as long as you don't ""over-pod"" the thing. It can get pretty distorted and you have to tone down your volume to match your previous output levels.

One innovation is the addition of a BlueTooth input. This is just unbelievably COOL that I can have all my cell phone/iPad conference background music ready to play wirelessly to this mixer and save that extra input for something else. The BlueTooth sound is... well.... its' BlueTooth... What did you expect, but you know... The average audience will never know the difference.

Its also got a mini 1/8"" input. Way rare in a mixer of this size. This is great, to input the sound of the room's PowerPoint laptop, when using an 1/8"" cable run.

Another really really cool thing is the onboard digital SD card recorder. How many times has a client wanted to record the audio of a speech separately for CD or file sales? Now you can offer this too without having to hire another sound guy for that task. Easy Peazy!

Finally, as far as features are concerned, this unit also shows up in Livestreaming Studio software as your choice if ""main L+R, and/or each of twelve channels individually.

Now for my ""necessary"" Bastardization of a perfectly good new mixer, as my ""slight"" ADHD forces me to customize the thing to my exact liking. This includes some oddities that not everyone else may agree with me on, like if you have eight XLR inputs, why do they call inputs 1-thru-4 ""1-thru-4"" and then call inputs 5-thru-8, ""5/6, 7/8/, 9/10, 11/12"" respectively? Now before some people people get into a tissy-fit on how I should know my inputs and that the 1/4"" phono inputs are exactly those extra numbers.... I know that.

It's just that if I'm almost never gonna use them that way, then why not just re-name all the labels to fit my exact need? This way when all hell breaks loose and we're hot in the game and you got 8-mikes live on-stage and music playing and PowerPoints cued-up and Livestream needing switching and titles galore, you don't get mixed up when mike#7 needs adjustment and you have to remember that its label says ""9/10"".

So I digress back to my original point, which is that I re-label the mixer by printing out my preferred label names on shipping label paper, cut them out to fit, and place them carefully on top of the offending original mixer labels. (see pictures below)

First I call inputs # ""5, 6, 7 & 8"" just that, and input #9 = ""music"" That's where I'd use the BlueTooth for my ipad music and/or input from a PowerPoint PC/Mp3 player and/or an analog player via the RCA's.

Next, I covered up (with electrical tape) the ""Mon1 & Mon2"" along with their respective 1/4"" phone connectors, as I have no use for these as of yet. (see pictures below)

Now you might ask why I covered up the ""MAIN"" XLR outputs? Because they weren't able to be separated from the USB output volumes, and I needed a way to have separate USB to Livestream volumes as of the ""Room"" volume control which in many cases have to be different.
So I took the ""Ctl Room"" output, as this DOES in fact have a separate master volume control and made that my ""MAIN ROOM"" output to go to the house speakers. I just have to have a 1/4"" to XLR adapter for each output.

Now I have separate ""Main Output"" Volume Controls. One for Livestream ""WEB"" and one for the House Sound, ""MAIN ROOM"" (see pictures below)

I'm now really happy with the outcome, with exception of the fact that I'd prefer to reverse the ""MAIN ROOM"" and ""WEB"" knob/sliders to have the slider be the ""ROOM"" and the knob be the USB, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way.

Lastly, This mixer come bundled with lots and lots of software for music editing, sounds, recording and audio mixing. Way too much for what I need it for, but it's nice to know its there if I need it. It's a matter of fact it's kind of confusing which software to actually use in case all you want is the DAW. The instructions aren't all that logical to me and it's amazing that I got it to work at all.

Anyway, I've taken enough of your time with my review here, that of which many of you might not fully understand my convoluted ways of navigating my equipment to my preferences.",4.0
"Great heavy-gauge strings. Worked well for drop-C tuning. If you want the Arch Enemy tone, you should like these.",5.0
"I have had this pedal for 6 months now and really like it.  I had been using a rack system with an ADA MP-1 which I really like the distortion tone of, I don't regret moving away from that to the simplicity of a pedal board and this as the main pedal.  The integrated noise gate is excellent.  Having the two gain settings is nice. I'm really happy with the distortion sound. I haven't really dialed in a solid clean sound, but I hardly play clean.
Some things I think are worth mentioning:
-I can put other distortion pedals in front of this and use this as a preamp, (I'm plugging into a rack power amp) If the pedals are not excessively noisy the noise gate will still work, there is a balance between getting it set for pedals before it and having it not affect the tone when using the distortion channel on the theta. Using this as a preamp after a distortion pedal doesn't seem to make any excessive noise.
-Using the preamp pushing the distortion it took some tweaking to get the levels even between the clean and distortion channels.  I could still run more gain/volume out of this if it weren't for trying to match the preamp/clean output to when the distortion is engaged.  But it probably isn't necessary to go any hotter. You can get a ridiculous amount of distortion and still clean it up with the decimator.",5.0
"I think any reviewers who complain about the sound will always complain about the sound, no matter what improvements are possible.  The fact that it's a tiny transmitter and costs very little makes up for any cons the product may have.  Certainly not the greatest feature to add to your iPod, but it's nice to have this on long trips in the car.  Once in a while it would irritate me... the static would get bad, so I'd pick it up and the static would go away, but as soon as I put it back it would start again.  Many times I ended up just holding it while driving, or setting in my crotch area and it wouldn't produce static.  Still, easy to use, cheap plastic but affordable, and really I won't use it that much anyway... If you're planning on using a transmitter every day go ahead and spend some more on a better machine.  Don't expect this to work forever.",4.0

I purchased this shock mount to use with a Rode NT-1 and it works perfectly.  The output connector end of the Rode is threaded and it has a large ring nut which screws onto it and holds the mic in the original Rode mic clip .  This type of shock mount is available from other manufacturers but most of them have a threaded ring which holds the mic in place and the threaded end of the Rode NT-1 is too wide for those mounts.  This one has a simple ring through which the threaded end of the Rode fits easily and then the ring nut is screwed on and the mic is firmly held in place.  If you have a mic which is attached with a ring nut then this shock mount should work very well.,5.0
"Overall, I was satisfied with the bow for the price. It is a good starter bow for the money. The construction is good and uses some nice materials. The screw is solid and easy to adjust. The frog uses a nice pearl material which gives an elegant look. The hairs took to the rosin easily. The wood is a dark cherry color which complements my violin so I am pretty happy over overall.

The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because It took two orders. First, the bow arrived and the tip was broken. The seller was very easy to work with and very responsive. Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, Amazon wanted me to send it back in and place a reorder. The seller went ahead and sent me one in the meantime so I was happy about that. In all fairness, it was probably Amazon's fault in the first place as Amazon didn't do a good job of packaging it correctly. The only other disappointment was a few of the hairs were broken when I received the replacement so I had to trim it.

All in all, a good product for the money if you're looking for a decent starter bow.",4.0

"Most of the reviews on the HISONIC HS120B where good so I  decided to purchase as I needed something right now.  I have been very pleased with this unit from the get go..

It amplify s the voice with good volume and good clarity, and in the situation I use it has exceeded my expectations.

One thing you have to watch is recharging if you need it to work without mains power. When it runs out of battery power it happens quite quickly so make sure you recharge before each use. I get about 2 hours useable time.

 I have only used this unit with ipod music connection once and it was fine up to a certain volume but was not to  good at high levels.. Some distortion.

"I run a small production company and wanted to add a strobe light to my lighting kit. I'll use it on certain shoots if that's a type of effect we need it for. It works really well with my hazer machines which reflect the light to give a nice effect to a scene. The compact size makes it easy to fit in my light case with all my other equipment already there. It also makes it easy to hide inside a shot. The packaging was adequate; it got to me undamaged, but I think the cardboard box is a little flimsy and could be an issue during some shipment. The value for this product is very good. So maybe the packaging can't be helped at that price-point. The product is very affordable and worth the value. It feels a little light and fragile. But again, for the price, I don't really have a strong complaint about this. I didn't have to contact customer support for this purchase, it came out of the box and worked fine. I love the variable strobe dial on top that gives this product a lot more punch and customization. Other than the thin box and the fragile feel of the product, I have no complaints about this purchase, but even those complaints and very big ones.

"I have been a consumer of Amazon for a number of year now, and often use product reviews to make and informed decision when purchasing a product. So I thought it's only fair that I pay it forward. This is my first ever Amazon review.

I bought this for my wife as an early Christmas gift and she loves it! The song selection isn't the best. But an item of note that isn't mentioned in the product description, is that you can down load Karaoke songs off of you tube to a USB thumb drive. They have to be saved in AVI format, and can be played in the movie mode under the APP section of the system.

My guess is that they don't mention this feature is because Enter-Tech wants to make money off of their song chips. As mentioned in another review, I think a 5.1 system would work best. We have a 2.1 system and have that odd delay that is produced when singing into the microphone. Going to be investing in a 5.1 system soon, hoping the delay will be eliminated.

But all in all a great product....we are very happy with it!",5.0

I might not have the ideal setup to try it, as I am using an electric nylon guitar where most would be playing steel strings, but I think my test gives a good indication of what kinds of sounds you can get out of this pedal.

The pedal feels solidly built, knobs are nice, the bypass button has a nice tactile feel to it and a nice clicking sound. It can be run off a 9V battery (included) or via a power supply. I often find the battery a bit of a tight squeeze right up against the circuitboard in the Joyo pedals, so some care needs to be taken.

As for sound quality, I think it has an interesting character and some nice sonic possibilities.

"After working in radio for almost 30 years, I found myself needing to set up a broadcast-quality studio at home. After reading reviews for the MXL 770 and a Monoprice mic that is the same model rebranded, I ordered it. I was blown away by what a good microphone this is. It's not just a good condenser mic for the price; it's a good mic, period. It compares very favorably to the RE20 mics I've used for most of my career.

I'm recording in a spare room that doesn't have great acoustics (although many professional studios I've worked in weren't any better), and I don't have any issues at all with reverb or picking up stray sounds. I think some people who have had those issues may have been speaking into the end; the pickup pattern requires you to speak into one side of the mic. I made the same mistake when I first set it up, and after reading the manual, I made sure I was speaking into the mic with it facing up (down is fine, too), and with the logo toward me. When used correctly, the MXL 770 doesn't pick up anything from behind (my computer and mixer are in front of a window, and that's not a problem), and it has a nice range.

I have always tended to work the mic up close, and I also had to adjust my technique to stay 4-6 inches from it. Between proper positioning and adding a windscreen (for my money, much more functional than a pop filter), the MXL 770 produces sound every bit as good as I've gotten with mics that were five or six times the price. Whether you're podcasting or setting up a home recording studio, this an excellent and very versatile choice.",5.0

"I don't know if this has been pointed out yet, but one of the main reasons I chose these headphones was due to their very low ""impedance"" of 38 ohms.  Since the lower the impedance number, the louder they're supposed to be on battery-powered devices. (in my case an Olympus LS-11 recorder/player, and a Roland R-05 recorder/player.).  When I plugged these phones into my laptop, (powered) they are plenty loud, though I was surprised how 'flat' the sound was, in other words, it seemed bass/treble/mid-range levels were all about equal.  (This is not necessarily bad, thogh I had expected to hear more bass and brilliance since they're relatively higher-resolution.  Anyway, the volume level was very adequate with a powered device.  HOWEVER, when I plugged them into my Olympus and/or Roland player/recorders, the volume was VERY quiet.  I insured that the phones cord was plugged in securely and completely and both ends.  This made no difference, and when I plugged them back into the laptop, the volume was once again very loud.  ????  W.T.F???  I verified that the ones I bought were indeed 38 ohms, by checking on the box specifications.  I know they work fine otherwise, so the only thing I can think of is that either they are mis-represented with a lower-than-actual impedance, or, the assembly put the wrong phones into this box (doubtful.).  I'm not TOO upset since most (80%) of my listening witll be on powered equipment, such as my laptop. I even get better loudness from my BOSE quietcomfort 15's, hooked up to the same player??  Since BOSE doesn't publish their specs, like the wusses that make their policies are, I don't know their impedance, but suspect it is much higher than 38!!  The BOSE should be quieter!!  As I am not too upset I will not give a bad review overall.  (I'm just going to get to good earbuds to use with my players, etc.)  Also, I have not tested these with my iphone, but will try that shortly.  Has anyone else noticed this?

"My husband owns a wonderful custom-made bass guitar that has fast action and a wonderful sound, but it is very heavy.  He's tried many straps over the years including the extra-wide and foam padded varieties, but all leave his shoulder very sore after a 3-hour gig.  Luckily, we came across the Planet Waves Dare guitar strap.  Its based on a very simple idea: distribute the weight between both shoulders.  Its extremely easy to set up and works very well; it has dramatically improved his shoulder comfort during long gigs.  It can be adjusted from a length of about 3 feet up to about 5 feet long.  Unlike some belt-based designs, this requires absolutely no modification to your guitar.  All you need to do is adjust the length, attach to your existing strap knobs, and start playing.  Its well-made, built to last, and not expensive.  If your guitar or bass is heavy, you really should try this strap!",5.0

A word of caution though as it does not come with any cables nor is it wireless/wifi based, so make sure you have the correct set-up in order to use this right out of the box.",5.0

"This is the second Chauvet controller I have bought. My first purchase was the Obey 3 which is a fine controller except that you can't control individual lights. Naturally I grew out of the Obey 3 when I learned more about DMX programming and lighting controllers. If you are new to lights, sometimes you may want some lights to be static or working as wash lights while others are chasing or fading between colors. This controller would allow you to have four independent settings for four plus lights. Some controllers have limits on how many lights they can support. for instance, the Obey 40 can only control 12 lights.

Some people complain that these controllers feel cheap, but they are cheap, yet, they function very well. The material cost is low so that it price can be low for the customer. My Obey 3 worked perfectly everytime I used it, and I have the same expectation for this one.

Pay attention to the DMX channels on the back of the controller, another nice feature that Chauvet includes by printing basic instructions on the underside of the controller for quick reference. The fixture controls don't follow the typical 1-17, 18-35 pattern.

Note: when you plug and turn this controller on, it has no lights that indicate it is operating until you hit a fixture button. I messed around with this thing trying to make it work for about ten minutes before I discovered this. I almost sent it back. The LEDs will flicker when it turns, but that is it. Once you activate a fixture, things start happening.

My only question is whether the fourth fader will control Amber and white. The manual does not say outside of the fact that it will control white.",5.0

"No issues.  I wanted something that would be portable, sound good and easy to carry.  The 35lbs that is somewhere on the page is wrong.  It weighs maybe 10 pounds at the most.

I hooked it up, and as others have said the quick start guide is a little confusing but I managed to plug though.  Hook in the battery and get moving.  In order to get the battery in you have to turn the screws on the bottom a little, slide the thing out and then plug in the battery.  In order to get it back in you have to angle the part and slide it back in.  It can be done.

I turned it on and tried it with my bluetooth.  It works great.  It isn't super loud but the base and treble are really nice.  You can fiddle with a few things to make it sound better.  I was really impressed with how clear the sound was coming out from the thing.  Good job there.  It has a hookup for whatever you want to plug into it.

It would be excellent for a small group of people.  Sound is right for an intimate gathering.

"I heard about SubDudes in an online forum and they sounded like they might help with a floor resonance problem I was having, my home was built on a raised floor and there is considerable surface area and a material that can be excited by my double subs. A quick consideration, my subs are under my HDTV stand and I had just enough room for the additional height from the dudes. This meant I had to remove the spikes from my subs, well my sub has a downward firing port which would then be 'sealed' by the Subdude platform. I decided to turn them upside down which allowed the port to fire between the two foam feet. I checked with Auralux support who was helpful and checked with the engineers, they felt that configuration should work fine.

As for the sound, I feel it is well improved, previously material with significant bass would cause the floor to occasionally 'play along'. After adding the SubDudes I hear just the sub, or more correctly the music. The bass now has more melody, and greater low end extension, it's performing as designed. The occasional room rattles from pictures on the wall or the like are also reduced, when one does show up a piece of moleskin quickly solves the problem. In conclusion I found the SubDudes made a noticeable improvement to my system and I would recommend them.",4.0

"This is actually a great beginner keyboard.  The tutorial system is good, and the sounds are good.  However, for beginners(like me), you will need some direction getting you PC to communicate the MIDI files to your keyboard.  Unfortunately, the 800 number will support this product using the same manual in the box.  If you write to Casio, it will take a week to two weeks to get the information I can provide you.  So here it is for those who need it:
  1.) The casio MIDI cables must be connected in opposite order, meaning the output-end of the cable goes into the input receiver of your keyboard.  The input-end of the cable goes into the output receiver of your keyboard.  Its counterintuitive, but this is the only way it will work.
  2.) You must configure your sound-card by going into \'Control Panel'\'Sounds and Audio Devices'.  Choose the 'Audio Devices' tab.  You will find one of the boxes reads 'MIDI music playback'.  Make the default device 'MPU-401' by choosing it from the drop-down menu.  Hit 'Apply' then 'OK'.
  3.) The MIDI software refered to as not supported in the user manual and by the 800 number is simply MS Media Player or Real 1 Player.  Simply open an MIDI file with your keyboard onwith the keyboard set to GM mode 'on'.  Some or all of the song will play through the keyboard speakers.  The Navigation channel on the keyboard will allow you to pick-up different ranges the MIDI file is playing.
I hope someone finds this helpful.  Once I got it up and running, I learned the tune from 'Cheers' in a matter of two hours with very limited exposure to piano playing.  It is a very good investment for those who are musically inclined but do not want to go through paying for lessons!  I highly recommend it now.",5.0

"Note: I play on a seagull coastline spruce (shorter scale, thus lower string tension)

Pros:
-lasts a long time
-smooth feel, a bit slicker than the exps, but not enough to affect play (I do have dry hands though, so coated strings seem to suit me better than people with sweaty hands)
-nice and balanced without the overly bright and jangly tone that new strings tend to have (even compared to other coated strings like daddario exps)
-all of the strings are coated
-string noise is minimized
-strumming/fingerpicking is easier

Cons:
-for people who want a bit more grip on their strings, you may prefer different strings (i.e. If you're someone who likes to bend a lot, these may not be for you)
-for people who do like the bright and jangly tone that comes with new strings, you may not like these strings as they may sound ""muffled"" in comparison (even when brand new)
-they're a bit more stiff when brand new in comparison to other strings. A good stretch and some playing does appear to resolve this.",5.0

Granted it's not sudio quality, but I don't like the overly glossy recording sound anyway.

This guitar strap is beautiful, very soft but substantial and certainly holds very well across his shoulder. The leather is quite thick (double-sided) and at one attachment end, it had to be shaved down a little for the knob to fit. On a guitar with a more prominent knob, this would probably not be an issue. The design is fairly plain with a series of decorative slots cut on the horizontal that allow length adjustment.

"There are few even semi-decent double guitar bags out there - That's a shame - So obvious you think someone would get it right as a double bag makes dragging two guitars to the gig a much easier proposition.

This was the best one I could find but it has its design flaws:  Straps are not particularly heavy duty. Plastic pads on the straps are worthless and add no comfort for lugging two guitars. Same can be said for all the handles. Also the straps and handles are attached via rivets (as opposed to using super heavy stitching - I can see these things pulling loose at some point). AND the shoulder straps aren't removable. Zippers aren't particularly great and tend to stick and catch on the bag interior lining. Foam should be heavier and the quality of the nylon exterior isn't the best. My biggest complaint is that the one exterior pocket (yes there's only one - there really should be two if not more AND the one pocket here isn't that big) is closed with two belt buckle style straps. This is just stupid - While some may think it looks ""cool,"" it's highly ineffective & a pain to close - A zippered pocket would've been substantially better here. You've got two large metal buckles that can press into and ding the guitar. Also , since it's not ""zipped"" shut things like patch cables, capos, pics etc. can fall out even when it's ""closed"".

Overall, this is useable - but should be better constructed for the price (or cost less as is. For a lesser price, this could be a good value in spite of the flaws I cite). A few years back I bought an awesome double bag for electric bass (for less $ than this) - Everything I've mentioned above was done well on that double bag-  Now... if I can just find out who made it - I'll be buying their guitar version next time.",3.0

"It gets five stars for the price. This is not a definitive overdrive by any means but for <$30 it's a solid pedal. I found the tone to be a little too trebley but by dialing the bass to 3 o'clock and the treble to 10 I got what I wanted. If you set the drive low, it gets a tube screamer-like crackle and if you set it high, it's as intense as a distortion, definitely more intense than most overdrives go. Again, this shouldn't be compared to distortions/overdrives in the $150+ range but if you're just starting out or you're on a budget this will do you just fine. It is a bit clunky though so be warned that it won't fit on a pedalboard as neatly as a Boss pedal would.",5.0

"A pro level bass with incredible sounding Bartolini pickups. The bass is very light weight and has a fast thin neck making it very easy to play. The active electronics with a bass boost switch really make this bass come alive. At first I was a bit put off by the flat finish that allows you to feel the grain of the wood, but that really means that it will look great for years to come as you won't have to polish all those finger prints off it. I've played for 48 years and find Ibanez SR basses to be some of the best. The Bartolini pickups are my favorite for full sounding bottom end that is clear and doesn't boom. You won't be disappointed with the sound and ease of playing with this bass.

"Battery run out fast, just over a hour of recording.  display is hi-res, sharp text but could had been better layout, the mic is very senstive, it can be as for DSLR direct plug in to record sound but some dslr has AGC noise like canon you had to output very high to remove the agc noise but will cause over senstive recording in some case.

The build quality is the biggest let down, it won't seem to last long, but you get what you paid for, is small enough to put in your pocket and use as interview mic.",3.0

"Really great value. I later realized that my Blue Yeti Pro wouldn't fit in this but that's my mistake. I was still able to easily screw my mic to the end of the mount, so if you have a Blue Yeti, this product might not be for you. I'm still very satisfied and will be keeping mine. Looks fantastic with my whole setup and very professional.",5.0

"I play multiple shows every week and I don't want to change my strings after every show. I play a Taylor 815CE. Elixirs sound great for the longest time compared to other strings. They take a little getting used to if you've never played a coated string, but they'll win you over when they sound brand new for three times longer than strings you've used in the past.

Also, most strings sound very twangy when you first restring your guitar. If you like that sound, that's great. I like the sound of strings once they've had a little time to break in. Elixirs sound ""broken-in"" right when you restring the guitar and keep their bright and rich tone for up to three weeks with heavy play. I used to have to change my strings weekly.",5.0
"I have the 76 keys bag and its been in my possession for several years now with heavy steady use.  I have never ever ever had an issue with the zippers, what are you guys packing in it to have such issues?  Really.  You get a lot of bang for the buck with this bag.  I am getting ready to order another one for my Roland VR-700 and she is my baby that I trust this bag enough to protect her just like my WK3000.  This bag has the same amount of padding as the Gator bags in which you are paying for the name!",5.0

"It's built like a tank. It fell about 12 feet through a ceiling once (long story) and it's fine. I mean FINE! I used to have an SWR workingman's 10 with an extension cabinet and this single 12 sounded better. If you can get a used one for $400 like I did, you can't go wrong!",5.0

"I am blown away at how good this reverb sounds. I upgraded my Peavey TT Studio Pro (AWESOME) from the stock 9"" Accutronics to a MOD 9"" 3 spring and it sounded better but did not wow me. I measured the Peavey cab and the 16"" fits perfectly. Totally different reverb! Smooth as silk and open compared to the other reverb. Instantly noticed the difference. Sounds huge if you want it to or add just a pinch to fill the space. I recommend the reverb bag due to the feedback at higher levels of reverb (surf mode) but the bag fixed the feedback no problem. This spring reverb is a must have. Better than any of my reverb pedals.",5.0

"I was not impressed with this ukulele, even as a student uke. The finish was not even, and the tone was not good. When it arrived, I didn't expect it to be in tune but the string that should have been the lowest on the uke (the C) was strung the tightest, making it the highest. This resulted in it constantly going higher as I played and having to adjust it every few strums. I also think the frets or saddle were not on properly because even when it was in tune, the chords sounded wrong, they were not in tune. I sent it back.",1.0
"I read a few reviews for this violin before I bought it and all said it was a good violin for a beginner, however I am finding this to not be the case.  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and since then I had to pay to get the bridge put on properly, tuned and the bow fixed. I took my daughter for her first lesson and found out that the tuning keys will not stay tight and now I have to get that fixed.  I have already spent about as much to fix the violin as I originally paid for it. I now have about $200 wrapped up in this violin.  I could have bought a good one from a local music store for about $350.  Wishing I would have done that now.  This is not a good violin. Not even for a beginner. It has been in the shop getting fixed more than it has been played.",1.0

"I own a few guitars, les paul, tom anderson, gretsch, etc. I like this guitar mainly for the metal flake, it is ridiculous. I think it plays fairly well out of the bag. I will be changing out the bridge saddles to graph tech, changing out the tuners to the fender locking and the nut to a graph tech also, strap locks certainly. I will have to pull the pick guard to see the pots but I suspect they are el cheap. Swapping out to a decent set of 500 k audio taper is a good idea. The pickups are good, I would recommend this guitar. All my documentation is in Spanish, this thing is straight out of Mexico",4.0

"14 months after purchase, saw that the speakers wouldn't power on.

"I bought two of these a few months ago based on the price. From the only review listed and the pictures, they looked like they would work well.

My first disappointment came when they arrived. Essentially, they are made from a plastic plate with two plastic dowels screwed in from the back. They look and feel very flimsy. I should have thrown them away at first glance. But, I didn't.

Instead, I mounted them and hung my guitars; and last night, the second disappointment came. My pristine Gibson came crashing to the ground. I have already removed both of the hangers and they are currently residing in my waste can.

I would not recommend these to anyone; not ANYONE...",1.0
"I've owned a bunch of different BT headphones over the years (including the Plantronics BackBeat 903+ - Loved , PUMP HD SPORTBUDS - Good waterproof but didn't like sound quality or feel, Jaybird X2 - returned hated the ear feel,  Motorola S9 - good, but didn't like sound quality, Vproof - cheap, poor battery and sound sucked, Jabra Sport - Good headphones, but very poor battery life) and was tired of paying over $100 for a pair of BT headphones. I figured for $30 I would give the Mpow Swifts a shot. Well, I will have to say that they are right now my favorite BT headphones other than my beloved Plantronics BackBeat 903+ (that I had two pairs of). I've had the headphones for nearly a year now, and they have held up. I use them 3 to 5 times a week, for anywhere from an hour to as long as the battery will run for.

PROS:
- The ability to pair them with my iPhone 6 and my Macbook at the same time. I can be listening to music on the Mac, have a call come in on the phone, switch over, take the call, and switch back to listening to music. Love that feature.
- Good battery play time for the size of the headphones. I get a solid 4 to 5 hours of listening time out of a single charge.
- Audio quality is very good for my listening preference. I haven't heard audio breakup that I had with other headphones.
- Main power button acts as Siri, play/pause and call answer button.
- In-ear audio voice prompts when paired, battery low, incoming call, and so on. Most cheap BT headphones only beep at you.
- Bluetooth 4

CONS:
- Volume control buttons can be a bit tricky to hit.
- When you hear the battery low warning you only have a little time left before they power off.
- Charging port can be a bit tricky to open with the rubber cover, and I can see why some might complain. I can see if you pushed to hard on the USB micro charging port how this could break, but that seems to be true about many of these micro USB connectors on smaller products.
- Microphone sound pickup for phone calls is OK, but not great. The mic is only on the right hear phone, and works best if you hold your right hand up as if your speaking into your hand to direct audio to the microphone. But I do this anyways to help with phone audio quality on all BT headphones.

In the end, I feel like the $30 I spent on these BT headphones was well worth the money. The only other BT headphones I would consider replacing them with right now is the newer Plantronics Backbeat Fits. But at almost a $100 difference in price I'll stick with the Mpow Swifts for now.",4.0
"for a Mendini brand, price of it is not cheap, however, issues about the quality of sound it produce are affected by the following factors. 1.) the status and quality of the reed you use. ( must not have cracks, the thickness and its reaction to humidity and the fitting must be 100% with the mouthpiece ) 2.) the cork in the neck must be in good condition and should tightly fit with the mouthpiece. 3.) must not have air leaks in each hole pads if properly covered, by proper finger position 4.) the skills of the player to control air pressure applied to the instrument to achieve the desired tone. ( the last factor can be perfected during practice sessions ). sax is a very emotional instrument. That is why many musicians prefer it. It paves away stress. Wind instruments help keep our lungs healthy.",5.0

"One of the final necessary 'improvements' for my home VO recording studio. I've had the Samson SP01 studio condenser mike for quite a while now and the sound of it is already amazing but with this added to it, I really noticed a sound quality improvement in the recording already. Slight vibrations from the mike were completely removed. Adds that much more of a professional look to it too. Love it.",5.0

"Very happy with the Zoom H5. It has worked well in multiple shooting scenarios - self shot video (recorded onto the SD card in the Zoom plus connected directly into the camera's mic jack - having a viable backup is no joke), wedding video shoot to capture the bride and groom's vows as well as a musical performance, as well as straight audio recording from a mixer for podcast production, and live recording of meetings to ensure everything was captured for the later transcription of the meeting minutes. This thing is very versatile and easy to throw into a backpack and carry around as needed - it's great. I will be traveling internationally soon, and plan to bring a travel XLR microphone with me to record podcasts per the podcast schedule while away. I've already tested this and it works great. Finally, I don't do many field interviews (yet) but will definitely have this recorder with me when I do them. The interchangeable capsules really extend the usability as well - I have purchased the H6 Shotgun Mic capsule and used it successfully for some video shoots as well - very happy with all of the results I've gotten so far. Highly recommended!",5.0
"One of the key is messed up. It makes sort of broken noise but still...there is a sound. so...and probably just mine..

Perfect neck, great travel guitar tone... can actually sing along and still hear the guitar... Nice fit/finish, scalloped bracing, killer case (similar case would cost at least $40 if purchased separately).  As others have written, there is a chemical smell in the case, but, I believe it emanated from the strap, which does indeed smell like a refinery... who cares?  Air the case out for a day!

"The Samson R31S Microphone is a great microphone for the price. I bought this microphone about 5 months ago for recording EVP sessions with my voice recorder. The microphone runs off of the recorders batteries, and has an on/off switch on the side. The cord is 16  feet leaving plenty of room to walk around while the recorder is on a table. I will say that since the cord is so long, and the size of the microphone, its best to use this with a recorder stationary on a table or other flat surface. When walking around with it, unless the cord is wrapped up, it can get in the way. Even with the cord wrapped up, the microphone can feel bulky.

Quality wise, this microphone is decent. Thirty dollars seems to be the average price, and for the price, the sound quality is above average, assuming the recorder is a good quality. One note to make is that the cord comes with  inch stereo jack, not the standard 1/8 inch stereo jack that most voice recorders have. This can be easily fixed. At Radioshack they sell an adapter plug that can turn a 1/8 inch plug into a  inch for only a few dollars. For ghost hunting, I'll give the Samson R31S microphone 3 out of 5 stars",3.0

"This is one of the best Stratocasters I've ever played.

The guitar is really quiet even with the single coils.

The neck is really smooth and fast thanks to the satin finish on the back.

One pleasant surprise is the front of the head is finished with a high gloss vs the satin on the back of the neck.

This guitar plays VERY well and sounds just like you would expect a Strat to sound.

The finish is not to be believed! I have yet to see a picture on the web that does this finish (White Chrome Pearl) justice.

I'm sorry that the previous reviewer had a bad experience but mine has been damn near perfect so far.

This guitar is a Fender Special Run due to the finish and pickup configuration and in my opinion, FSR guitars are always pretty nice.

The only thing I had to do was change the strings, set the intonation and clean up the nut slots. I can now do dive bombs without
going out of tune.

Please, don't be put off because of one negative review. I can honestly say that I think whoever buys this guitar is going to have something pretty special.",5.0

"I own this guitar and it is one of the best values available. What Martin has done with this guitar is removed all of the extraneous bling and decoration that has nothing to do with the sound of the guitar and left an extremely well built and great sounding guitar.

Th all Mahogany (Sapale) construction gives it a warm earthy tone. It is not overly bright or harsh on the high end but is still very defined and crystal clear. The low end has the classic Martin growl. It is a beautiful calming sound. I tried to come up with a term to describe it, and it makes me think of smoke for some reason. You can really hear the wood in the sound. It makes you feel spiritually connected to the guitar.

I played a lot of guitars while searching for this one and I couldn't find a more appealing sound , or anything close to it for less than $1800. Even the more expensive Martins  were more of an upgrade in ""bling"" than in sound. You have to spend $2500 or more to really get a bettter sounding guitar.

Some might be turned off by the simplistic look, but I highly reccomend hearing this guitar before you jump to conlusions about appearance. I personnaly love the simplistic look. It reminds of something I might have seen Robert Johnson playing back in the day. As a blues man it fits my personality perfectly.

The action was just a hair high for my taste when I got the guitar, but I adjusted that in about 2 minutes by lowering the saddle when I changed the strings out.

Check out the unnoficial martin guitar forum and search for threads on the 15 series. It has a cult following. You cant go wrong with this guitar. It is by far the best deal for less than $1000.",5.0
"If you have a new or new-to-you mandolin and are just starting out, do yourself a favor and change to these strings right now. They're warm sounding, and far less painful on your fingers while you're learning than the cheap nickel strings that most instruments come from the manufacturer with. The tone is much more forgiving while you're learning intonation, and makes practice and performance a much more professional sounding affair.",5.0
Glad I found this strap as I'm into the whole western-style concho thing on a thinner strap.  Can't find anything like this at GC or anywhere else.  I put mine on a Les Paul Gold Top and it compliments it very well.  This strap would also look great on a Tele or a Gretsch hollowbody.  The only thing I would change is use different conchos for a few of them instead of a series of the same concho...and maybe use leather lace stitching along the edges instead of the plastic nylon binding...not a complaint just an idea.,4.0

Some accessories I purchased included: felt picks, neck strap, humidifier (to keep my uke from cracking), a case, extra strings. I thought about getting a stand and a tuner but opted out on the stand to save money and because I didn't truly need it, and I found a bunch of free tuner apps; there are also apps for finding chords, and some to teach you how to play.

But, at the same time I have a baby, so I cannot hook my rig up in our bedroom and wail away at full volume at night!! So when my dear son is sound asleep, I connect my guitar into it, hook up my ipod, and there I go!!!!! Just perfect!! I was reading all the other reviews and all these people are complaining about limp sounds, and cheap construction!! Guys..49.99$??? Please!! Do you expect the sound of a triple rectifier?!?! ""weak battery compartment"" Like, dude, just be careful!! The sounds are just what you need!! This little baby is VERY versatile!! Clean + Chorus + Delay = Marillion's Steve Rothery tone; Twang + Spring + Neck pickup = Great clean blues ala John Mayer; Crunch + a bit oh hall = Bryan Adams Summer of '69. Rock + Spring = AC/DC; Metal + a bit of Delay = GREAT lead tone!!! Of course, you're not gonna do Madison Square Garden with this, but to play around and practice, at home or on vacation, GRRRREAT!!! So, hey, guys, go get one of these!!! And all you negative complainers, c'mon man!!!!!!",5.0
"im reviewing the current 2015 limited version of this. The guitar is great, I love it but it's not the quality of the first mij guitars. Yep it's mij, not cij. I deducted a star for selling me a 1000.00 guitar with crap pots n switch, and not including even a gig bag. Seriously.. no warranty info, hang tags, nothing. You get a guitar in a box. Even a mim std comes with a bag.. I feel it's overpriced by about $200.00 but not one you see every day. 4 stars may be generous but I love fender, they'll make it up on the next one I hope.",4.0

"Like the title states, I am very disappointed. While testing out the strap, I played the guitar for a about a minute until I couldn't finish the song because the neck of the guitar kept sliding towards the ground (not the guitar's fault). While it was sliding, the strap dug into my neck and left painful red marks. It is super uncomfortable, poorly/cheaply made, and I can assure you that I will be returning it. I suggest you pay the extra $10 and get a better quality strap.",1.0
"This fixture does not give you individual control over the light bar sections (like most color bar fixtures allow).  It, in fact, doesn't even feature automatic programs that do any kinds of chases or anything.  It is really just like a single wash light in a bar shape.  This makes it only marginally more useful than any other wash light.  The price seems too good for what you get... and soon you'll discover the catch.  All the extra goodies in the bag, the remote, the carrying case, etc don't make up for the fact that this light has substandard operational design.

On the plus side... it is bright.  The optics are tight.  If you have a specific application for it and are fine with having basically zero control (even in 10-channel mode) over this light.... then you might find some use for it.  The lack of a 40-channel DMX color-mixing mode and basic color chase programs makes its usefulness VERY limited however.",2.0

"When I made the purchase for the 38 Classic Acoustic Guitar, I was enthusiastic! My package was suppose to arrive at my door today, but it arrived one day in advance. It was well packaged when I opened the box. However, I noticed that the guitar was very cheap. And the strings are made from some metal martial? (Which has rendered my ability to play the guitar) I thought I would purchase some new strings for the 38 Classic Acoustic Guitar, but decided to purchase another guitar more durable & more well crafted. Do I regret making the purchase for the 38 Classic Acoustic Guitar? In a way, yes! I only purchase this guitar because it was in my price range.

"I never expect much from knockdown furniture, but I was still disappointed. I had two big issues with this product.  The first issue is a problem with the side pieces.  The holes for the rails have pilot holes, which is good.  The problem was that both sides were drilled the same.  The pilot holes were drilled on both pieces as if they were both for the left side.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize the problem until after I had the rails installed. The instructions have you install the rails on the side boards before assembling the cabinet.  There's really no reason for that and I would have noticed the problem if I had put the cabinet together first. If I had noticed the problem before hand,  I could have easily drilled the pilot hole all the way through the side and corrected the problem.  That's how I ended up fixing it, but now I have ugly holes on the right side of the rack that are very visible.

The other problem is that there aren't enough screws to complete assembly.  The screws supplied fit both the rails and the casters.  There's not enough included to secure both.  I had to go buy more to secure the rails properly.  I checked the packaging and I received the number of screws they specied, but if you put a screw in each pilot hole they pre-drilled, they are short about 6 screws.

Aside from my extra holes ... the completed assembly looks pretty good.  They did a god job on the laminating in that only the back edge of the pressboard is left exposed. They also provide black covers for the screws. Be aware that this rack has a front rail only, so if you are mounting something heavy you'll need to put those items on the very bottom so that you have the bottom of the rack for support.

For some reason, the product picture has changed since I order.  This rack has the top portion of the rack sloped.  The current picture is just a standard rectangle rack.  Be sure you know what you're ordering.",2.0

"The price of this seemed to be lower than normal and I had read glowing reviews on this guitar on the various guitar forums. So I took a chance of ordering a guitar on line. Amazon was awesome as usual as far as delivery speed. It arrived very well packed. Fit and finish are very good, I noticed a few very small dimples on the back but not significant. Interior bracing etc well done. Rosewood is beautiful, the finish is really smooth and glossy. It looks like a more expensive instrument. An important note, the headstock is not the gaudy one in the Amazon picture. This is the Br-160A2, which is a newer model with 1 3/4 nut and a much plainer headstock. For me, if it was not one of the newer ones, it was going back. I think if Saga went with less bling on the headstock they would be selling more guitars. This one has the less ornate version and I like it.

I read that Adirondack tops take a while to break in. The guitar was very tight sounding right out of the box. Kinda tinny. As a side note, I had read about this thing called a tone rite that accelerates the break in process on guitars. I alse read that an aquarium pump and a way to attach it to the strings is a rough equivilent to the $150 tone rite. So I invested $6 in a pump and some rubber grommets and gave it three days on the guitar. I also switched out the strings to medium PB's. I am happy to say the the guitar is already mellowing out. It is clear, loud with a great bass and shiny trebles. Lots of harmonics, setup is spot on. Intonation perfect. Lets face it, people that buy this are trying to get a poor mans Martin Marquis. This thing is really close, not as dead ringer but close. I would say the only thing stopping it from the Martin tone is the trebles are still a little tinny on the high E. But as time goes on, that seems to be subsiding, and I have only had it a week. Overall I would have to say that this was a good purchase, for the money you can't go wrong. Martin purist don't like this guitar because you are getting very close to the same result for about 6 times less. The fact that these seem to be sold out everywhere is an indication of their worth.",4.0

"Bought one of these for 50% off at my local music store.  A volume pedal actually provides foot control of an input signal. Depending on placement, this can be used as a volume controller or and effects controller.  A conventional volume pedal works like this:
1)  Tilt it back and the volume goes down.
2) Press it forward and the volume goes up
3) Take your foot off it - the volume stays put
  THIS PEDAL DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
The pictures show them tilted up like you would expect. In reality it is a solid block and lays flat on the floor.
It works as follows:
1)  Tilt it back and the volume goes down.
2) Press it forward and the volume goes up
  Press it ALL the way forward and the unit SILENTLY goes into bypass mode at the level you pre-select with a wheel on the side.
  Press it ALL the way forward again and the pedal becomes active again.
3) Take your foot off - THE VOLUME DOESN'T STAY PUT.  it rocks itself flat on whatever surface it's on - this corresponds to maximum volume.
  This is a significant functional difference from a conventional pedal.
The rest of the descriptions are straightforward...  Beautifully engineered unit, very solid, no moving parts to wear out or get noisy. Variable and bypass outputs allow creative panning effect between two signals.  Lovely logo glows red when the unit is active on battery, green on external power.

You can get a rubber cradle with sides to keep it from sliding off a pedal board,  I would love a cradle built to let it retain it's position when your foot is removed - that would make it a superior pedal, for the simplistic way I intended to use it -- as a volume pedal  The EHX site has a nice demo of interesting ways this pedal can be used --- as a superior effects controller.",3.0

I use this on a Macbook Pro running Pro Tools 9 (I did not installor needthe Cubase software). There were no drivers to install. PT immediate recognized the interface. There are no latency issues recording at 128. Some have mentioned that it's difficult to get loud enough audio from a condenser mic, but I have not had a problem yet. With the dial at 2 o'clock or so, I can get great levels with the mic directly connected, and not going through a PA/amp (which I prefer because I can pre-EQ everything).

"Parker's Parent company recently decided to end the Parker Acoustic line of guitars. They have been dumping them to the market to select dealers. Though this guitar is being sold for over a thousand dollars at MF or GC, it can be had for lower prices.

The solid woods are all good, but the feature that stand out is the Zero Fret.

The Zero Fret is fantastic for Open Strings. It creates a consistency in tone between open and fretted notes. This is actually quite a rarity. Very vital option since I play a lot of open strings with my solo fingerpicking.

The tone is robust and full. The Vinci strings that come with it are the proper gauge to get a full tone. Changing the strings on a Parker (I also own a P8E) changes the personality of the guitar. To get the right balance, I finally decided on Phosphor Bronze strings.

Want to listen to the PA22 in action? Here's a song I recorded at soundclick:

I've had it for 6 months or so, using it almost every day and have never had to change the batteries.

It has a bunch of modes I've never made use of.  I mainly use it for tuning standard tuning on acoustic guitars, which I just use the 'guitar' mode for.  There are a lot o features I'm not using, but it's nice to know they are there if the need arises.",5.0

"I think its a well made instrument.  A key point to make is don't buy this online through Amazon.  I'd actually suggest you not buy any ukulele from Amazon, but go through either a local shop or a reputable ukulele site that will set it up and make sure that once you get your instrument, its in playable shape.  I got mine as a birthday gift, but it was bought at a local shop.  If its setup properly, like mine, I think its a fantastic instrument.  The only faults i can find is that the frets are a little rough on the edges and that I personally am not convinced that an ukulele needs to be more ""treblely"" sounding, but if you're looking to buy a resonator uke then you know that already and won't mind.  Either way, its given me hundreds of hours of joy with the same strings and no extra tuning needed.",5.0

"I've been sitting and waiting on this Riptide model for so long, I am glad I finally have it.  This is a review of the newest model.  It's the one with new logo on the headstock running vertically, re-designed smaller bridge, larger front off-set sound hole and new satin finish.  I bought mine from The Good Ukulele Company and had great customer service with Chris Sue.  But I'd like to share my review here.  I've read many mixed reviews over the years and I wanted to have my own take on it, so here goes.

This Riptide Tenor Mahogany model exceeded my expectations.  I've been looking for a tenor that had great looks, great projection and tone, and needed good low end and mid-range fullness.  Although Laminated, this uke really packs a punch!  I wanted a uke that sounds great for jazz and this one is amazing for this style of music.  Tonally, depending on how you play and the strings you put on, it can sound like a Les Paul and jazz chords just sound sweet and clear and robust.  It has decent sustain being laminate.  But it's built well and very strong and sturdy.

The tuning gears are sealed and they are smooth and turn like butter.  Great job here!  They hold tunings very well.

It has a very full round and outwardly projecting sound that's open.  Some mahoganies sound very closed in but this one is lovely.
I've tried Aquila strings on it, then Sarah Maisel GHS strings, and now have D'Addario Carbon tenors.  All strings i tried are with LOW G.  It's beautiful!  5 Stars for tone and volume!  The Dual Sound ports REALLY work and really makes a difference.  How to know?  cover the ports while playing and then open again and you will hear the difference.  no need to bend my neck forward anymore to hear myself play!

Physically, the uke feels great in my arms and the neck feels good considering i don't have large hands.  The neck is a bit thicker than I'm used to, but it's ok.  The frets are still a bit rough and sharp in certain areas, but that's just part of the issue of having it made overseas. It's passable.  The nut is plastic, but...the good thing is that its edges are smoothed off.  This is a huge deal and a plus because I can't tell you how many ukes i've tried where the edges of the nut are poking out due to the design, and they cut right into my fretting hand and index finger. a huge deal!  So thank you Boulder Creek for making sure this nut is sanded off and curving in instead of out.

The new bridge saddle design is pretty cool.  At first, I was frustrated with it because the factory had installed the strings too tight, and I could not pull out or get to one of the top strings to change out. It's not the traditional tie type, but rather you make knots into balls big enough to stop it before it goes through the hole, like bridge pin guitar type installation.  But the top string had not enough knot, so it went right into the hole and got stuck in there, making it very difficult to pull out.

There was barely any end tag left to grab even with tweezers, couldn't do it!  I emailed Boulder Creek and they helped with some suggestions and finally i got the string out with a lot of patience and 3 extra tools  (Pins, needle nose pliers and rubber thumb covers you find in offices if you're sorting paper!). I thought there was a design flaw in the bridge saddle design since the opening slot was so small,  i couldn't get in there to get the strings out.

but after that one crazy string error, all was good.  The design actually serves many purposes.  It's lovely to look at...very streamlined and visually stunning.  It's smaller footprint allows greater resonance and sustain on the sound board.  It hides the string ends nicely, so it looks neat and modern.  The slot has space to tuck some extra end tags in.  So...it actually is a pretty neat design, provided we leave enough end tag on string changes to pull them out later!

The satin finish is lovely.  Makes the uke look red under different lighting conditions, and sometimes a shiny brown.  Wood grain is open pore and nice.  The only things I didn't like are the interiors of the uke.  It matters because if you have dual sound ports positioned the way they are here on this style of uke, you are now able to see everything inside...a window into a world of wonder!

So with this, the interior edges of the sound ports were a bit rough with wood splinters and glue marks. and also you can see the long screws poking through the bridge from the top, so it looks either incomplete or a mistake.  I wrote to Jeff Strametz, CEO of Boulder Creek and he is a wonderful person who has great customer service. He assured me that issue has been fixed and next model will be addressed.  yay!

Other than the messy interior (maybe just my particular uke) , the whole uke is sheer happiness for what I was looking for.
Boulder Creek has come a long way, bounced back, and their customer service is top notch in the sense that you can talk to real people, real musicians, who really care about their product and loyal fans to work together as a family / community to continue improving their instruments.  I'm also happy with it because I've been wanting a Riptide uke for so long, seeing many iterations go by, and finally just trying one out and having it exceed my expectations.  So...looking at the whole package here, not just the tone.  When you buy a Riptide or any Boulder Creek instrument, you're not just buying the product, but joining a dedicated community of like minded people who are passionate about what they do and how they do it.

I'm hooked and now I want the other models and can't wait to see what's new coming out of Boulder Creek next year...more improvements, and more models.  Love my new tenor!",4.0
"The clean sound is never really clean, even with the knob all the way to the clean setting. That's a drag because any kind of slap sound or finger style gets eaten up by the overdrive. The overdrive doesn't sound too bad but it breaks up too much even at the lowest setting so if you are looking for something with a lighter growl, like the way an SVT starts to break up, this probably won't be for you. Other than that, it's extremely well made with very nice pots as well. ***The bass big muff can get a really good overdrive sound on it's lower settings even though it's advertised as a fuzz. The bass big muff also is completely clean so slapping with overdrive sounds works out really well.",3.0

"I bought this pickup after a long search for the right pickup for my mandolin. I play in my church's worship band and was considering the K&K dual, but I knew in the back of my mind that it wouldn't quite sound as good as close mic'ing the instrument. When I came across this, I knew it looked like possibly just what I really wanted. I took the leap and am very glad I did. This thing needs to be matched with the deck or amp you're going to use but once matched the sound is incredible. I had some questions and so emailed Gregg Myers at MyersCo and he was super helpful. A wonderfully helpful and engaging man Gregg is just what we always hope is at the heart of a company and product. He truly cares about his customers and their satisfaction.

I plugged my pickup into a Digitech RP500, used the left (mono) XLR out with an impedance transformer on the end of the microphone cable plugged into the instrument input of my Yamaha THR10 set to ""Flat"". Set some digital delay, reverb, and a light chorus.....very phat indeed.

So, with excellent sound quality, incredible portability, and fantastic customer service you cannot go wrong. Buy it, you'll be glad you did.

"I was skeptical purchasing this drum set due to the limited information provided in the item description. However, I took a chance and am glad I did. This is not a junior drum set. It is indeed full-size.

The dimensions of the drums are: (width x depth) toms - 10x8, 12x9, 14x14; snare - 14x5.5; bass - 20x16

Based on that, this drum set would technically be considered a 'fusion' set. A standard or 'rock' set would typically consist of a 22"" bass drum, 12"" and 13"" toms, and a 16"" floor tom. This was not a deal-breaker for me as it still produces a good sound and the value for the price I paid was on par or even better than the junior drum sets being offered. (A junior drum set includes a 16"" bass drum and smaller toms and snare.)

The kit also contains one pair of 14"" hi-hat cymbals (with stand) and one 16"" crash cymbal (with stand). The quality of the cymbals is acceptable but not great, but that is to be expected with any cymbals that come with a kit at this price. (Good quality cymbals are expensive!)

Also included: a drum throne (which is rather small, but it does the job), ONE pair of sticks, a drum key, and an Allen wrench for making adjustments. Contrary to the item description, there is no stick bag or additional pairs of sticks included. No big deal for me as one call to Amazon customer service, and I was fairly compensated.

Assembly was not too difficult and took about an hour. There are no instructions provided, but it is pretty straightforward. (The sticky rubber piece goes on the rim of the bass drum where the pedal attaches.)

The look of the kit is very nice thanks to the black-coated hardware. (Both the drum rims AND all the stands are black-coated and seem as though they will be fairly durable. No chips yet, at least.)

The only issue I had was that one of the rims for the bass drum was warped and made correctly mounting the head difficult. Other than that, there was no damage to the other components of the set. (Even after UPS got done with it ;)

Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. I look forward to upgrading and replacing the drum heads and cymbals to turn this into an even higher quality kit.",5.0

I mention this because I use recorders in my other classes and when students have a hard time it is for one of those reasons... they either can't find the right place to put their fingers or they overblow and play the wrong note.

"I prefer over ear headphones (as you will see from my list below) but the 2 units of IEMs I do have are as good any you are going to hear and I use them all the time as there is only a minor noticeable loss in sound stage and detail from my at home over ear ones.

This review is strictly based on my opinion and tastes in sound and music. I am 53 years old and have lost the ability (happens as you get older) to hear certain hi frequencies, that those of you who are a fair bit younger can still hear and enjoy. The point being that I may not be overly affected by what some describe as high frequency screechiness or sibilance ( I prefer clear detailed highs, mids  and lows in their natural form to overpowered low detailed highs and muddy thumping bass).

Tested on iPad, with and without Oppo h2 Dac and Chord Mojo also on AV receiver.
Each unit was left to burn in 24/7 for seven days and listened to before and after. The Fostex, Beyerdynamics, Sennheisers and HIFIMAN became smoother, warmer and IMO  more enjoyable after the burn in. The other units mentioned did not seem to change radically or become any more enjoyable.

I have had the following headphones and returned them over the last 4 months ( some tested for 2 weeks, others for almost a month with music from techno, rock, pop and all the way to classical and opera (also used a audio reference cd for more comparisons).

Sennheiser 598( good sound but feel like cheap plastic and ear cups are shallow) - Shure 1540 ( smooth sound, wide soundstage fore closed back and very comfortable sent the back when the Fostex arrived) - Beyerdynamics  990 pro 250 Ohm( most comfortable earpads of all and close in sound to the t90) - master & dynamic M40 ( very nice build and sound, but earpads are to narrow and have a high clamping force) - Blue Lola ( sound ok but heavy and awkward) - Audio Technica M50 and Vmoda 100 ( both ok for the price, just not in the same league as the keepers).

Keepers.
Fostex TH900 ( my favourite of all for sound, looks and comfort)
Hifiman 400i ( wide soundstage, great sound and comfort) - Oppo pm3 ( great all-around sound and comfort also can't get them out of my wife's hands) - Beyerdynamic t90(crisp, clear, detailed and comfortable) - Bowers and Wilkins P7 ( awesome build quality, fantastic sound - a little on the smaller side in earpads).

These  2 have very positive reviews across the web and I really can't add anything significant to what has already been said.

IEMs - Westone W40 - great comfort with a ton of tips to choose from. Sound is clear and detailed and they are so comfortable that you forget they are in your ears.

Shure SE846 - a noticeable step above the W40s in build quality and sound.extremely well regarded across the web for these
Sound is detailed, clear and solid. They come with three different types of exchangeable tubes so that you can adjust for bright, neutral or more bassy sound. I wasn't as fond of the ear tips that came with these but end up using the silicon 12mm from the Westones thus solving the comfort issue. After testing, I went back to the neutral tubes and have enjoyed these ever since.

"The bow is satisfactory for a student bow.  It sounds nicer on my daughter's instrument than the bow that came with her student violin. My only two complaints are, it seems to break 2-3 strings every time it is played, it is not being used hard or inappropriately.  The other complaint is that the carbon fiber does not hold its arc when the hair is slightly tightened.  I would think that the carbon fiber would be rigid enough to hold its arc, but this bow acts as though it is made of plastic with regard to how the bow starts to bend when the hair is tightened.  I have checked to make sure that my daughter isn't over tightening the bow, and she is not.  If the hair is tightened so its not touching the stick, the hair can only be tightened very slightly before the stick begins to lose its arc.",3.0

It does not. I am using .10-.46 gauge strings and they still stick in the nut causing the guitar to go sharp after most bends or vibrato use.
Perhaps with lighter gauge strings - which I can't use, as I break them - it may be alright.

"This is an amazing tuner.  It is also super easy to use.  It automagically switches between traditional mode and poly mode, depending on if you play more than one note string at the same time.  I tune my guitar down a half step to Eb, so I was worried that the pedal wouldn't work.  At first, only single-note tuning worked.  Then I discovered a little button on the side that lets you choose the poly mode by repeatedly pressing it.  It does drop-d, capo mode (whatever that is) and flat tunings down to 5 half-steps below E!  Even better, it remembers the setting, so I don't have to change it to Eb every time I power on the pedal.
The case is solid and the tuner seems very sturdy.  There is no battery, so there should be no need to open it, and mine had star screws to discourage opening (which an allen wrench might still work on).  I can't imagine why you'd want to open it though.  It  did come with two pad strips for the bottom and a set of instructions that was so minimal it was printed on a business card size paper, and was just a picture explaining what the switch and button do.
Use:  It has a ""soft"" switch that does not ""click"" like other pedals, and so there is no sound externally when you turn it on.  Turning it on mutes the audio signal.  I would take one-half star off, because I sometimes like to have the tuner running while I play.  When you switch it on, there is an almost undetectable click in the audio signal, and a slightly louder click when turning it off, when the sound is enabled again. I don't know of a pedal that doesn't do this, but in fairness I thought I would mention it.  The tuner detects the notes incredibly fast and seems very accurate.  Once you get used to the polyphonic tuning, it is really hard to go back to normal mode.  Polyphonic is just so much faster and easier.  Note:  if you have the polyphonic setting to the wrong mode (e.g. E instead of Eb, in my case), it will not work!  You'll know it's wrong because it will only show some of the strings on the screen.  You can still use single note mode if you wish to do alternate tunings, and you can force the single note mode with the button on the side.
Audio:  It does not flavor the sound at all, as it mutes audio when on and bypasses the pedal circuitry when off.  Then again, since it mutes when on, that could be considered altering the sound.  That may be a good thing or bad thing.  I prefer to control my volume with a volume pedal.
Overall:  I would definitely purchase again, and recommend it.  Don't forget a power supply if you don't already have one!",5.0

"I purchased 2 of these kits to rewire my pedalboard. After extensive research, these came highly recommended instead of the more expensive George L's, Switchcraft, etc. The low profile of the connectors allows the pedals to be spaced closer together, making for a neater board. The connectors' design is great with the tab for soldering the shield wire to instead of trying to solder the shield to the housing. The included cable is equally great. Very flexible for routing around a board and very quiet.

The kits are 1/3 the price of Planet Waves, George L, Bullet, and others.

"I paired these speakers up with a Sound Blaster 5.1 sound card and they went together well.

The speakers have an amazing range. I get the nice thumping bass and crisp highs for my punk rock, and with the program that came with the sound card, it gets even better.

As far as quality goes, you can't expect too much from a set of <$100 monitors but these are outstanding. The speakers themselves are a little weak and will get distorted very easily of you crack up the volume. There's also a lot of white noise when the speakers are on standby so I always have to turn them off even if I'm going to be away for a short period of time.

I don't care much for the EQ on the speaker itself because there isn't much to control. The Bass knob is the only one you need and that's to give it that kick.

But anyways, for the price, these moniters can't be beat. Great for home recording, gaming, movies, and just listening to some music.",4.0

It is well built and not cheesy, but it just doesn't conform well to the construction of my banjo.

"The day I got this in the mail, was the day my overall guitar sound really went to the next level! I have played guitar for many many years, but I never really messed around with a looping pedal in the past, but within minutes of use, I had pretty much mastered this little gem and wondered why it took me so long to buy one in the first place.
It's simple! 1 push button, 1 knob, and hours of fun!
The one down side is the fact that you need to purchase a 9V power adapter separately to power this pedal, which Planet Waves sells right here on Amazon for cheap, and it works great.
I was also surprised at the size of this little guy...fits in the palm of your hand!

"I bought one of these from a pawn shop about a year ago for $55. At the time it was just an impulse buy. It was the cheapest bass on the shelf and I just bought it. It had damaged nobs and a broken pick guard.

Let me tell you though. I couldn't imagine having one of these new. It sounds so good for having such old strings on it. (haven't replaced them and only God knows how long these same strings were on here before I bought it.)

I play this at church every week and everyone always says the bass is great and really adds body to the music. (since there's only one other guitar playing usually.)

The Thing I must say though is that this bass is well-made. Solid as I said in the title. It just survived a head on car crash in the back seat without popping any of its old strings. I haven't checked to see if it's still in tune though.

This will probably be the only bass guitar I ever buy, as it was a once in a lifetime deal at the pawn shop for $55. This is definetly all I will ever need for any small time gigs.

Let me credit myself. I'm one of those guys that was always playing an electric guitar and decided to go bass one day and just never learned how to play bass specifically but knew how to play a guitar. You know what I mean?",4.0

"really wanted to love this one. it was $180, and the look is just awesome. but, in studio and on stage, i am pretty disappointed and here is why...

other amazon reviews suggested that it is pretty good about plosives / pops, but it's really not. even in the video demonstration one of the top reviews posted here, you can hear it popping almost immediately.

as for live settings - with any sort of louder rock band - it picks up a lot of the drums, no matter where you're standing. it seems to get excited by the highs of cymbals in a way that it doesn't for just your voice. it's also not super directional, so you really have to eat it on stage.

i also don't recommend it for anyone using any vocal processing (compressor, delay) unless you are using in-ear monitors. this thing feeds back way too easily.

after giving up on it, i went for a completely uncool looking mic - the EV 967 - which has brighter highs, deeper lows, an all around more ""studio"" sound on stage - and seems to pick up my voice and only my voice, even when i'm right next to my drummer.

the Super Deluxe 55 seems to be much better about anti-feedback and side rejection. might be worth the extra money if the style is super important to you. but remember that while you are committing to this look, you are buying a microphone that you NEED to be RIGHT AGAINST to pick up properly, covering a huge chunk of your face in an unflattering way.

I picked up a used PreSonus preamp, though, and it has definitely pushed the need for a new mic to the back burner (for the time being).  Just adding this little preamp brings out my vocal and acoustic guitar recordings so much in the mix, making them sound so much clearer and just more ""there"".

"An outstanding speaker! This new lightweight Eminence speaker replaces a nice, but very heavy Electro-Voice EVM-12L in my jazz guitar amp. Not only is my amp significantly lighter, but more importantly, the sound it produces is noticeably clearer and cleaner. According to the Eminence data sheet info, this newly developed neodymium design is appropriate for both bass guitar applications as well as for PA systems. I completely agree. It's like my amp woke up and cleared its throat!

I'm so impressed with this speaker that I bought a second one for another amp. I now have one installed in my vintage Polytone jazz guitar amp as well as in my new Fender Rumble 100 bass amp. I slightly modified the Fender cabinet by stapling in some R13 fiberglass insulation inside and also closing off the two ports, so I now have a fully sealed cabinet. The internal volume of the cabinet is less than 1.5 cubic feet -- within the recommended sealed enclosure specs for this 2512 speaker. I now have a very portable 20 lb. Fender amp that sounds nearly identical to my rather old and heavy Polytone...  and I can play either jazz guitar or upright bass on either amp and sound absolutely fantastic. These new Eminence Deltalite II speakers are superb. Highly recommended.",5.0

"I bought this stand as a gift for my fianc&eacute;.  He has been learning guitar on his own but hasn't really had a place to store it, until now!  Prior to owning this stand, he would just lean it up against the wall or couch which could easily lead to a guitar-breaking disaster!

The stand itself is pretty simple.  It arrives already put together and all you need to do is pry the legs apart to the width that you would like them to be.  After that, its storage-city for your guitar.  The guitar in the picture is a full-size guitar and it fits perfectly on the stand.  There are portions on the bottom that are made of a rubber type material that grips to the guitar and prevents it from sliding around or being easily knocked over.  I noticed other reviews where they didn't care for the angle that the guitar was kept at in this stand, but I haven't noticed anything like that with the one that we received.

Overall, Im very happy with this purchase.  It was inexpensive and does exactly what its supposed to do.  It takes up about as much space as the guitar itself would take up, but now we can just leave it sitting against the stand on the floor instead of having to find the right angle against a wall or piece of furniture.",5.0

"The name of this unit is clearly misleading. It cannot capture four discrete channels simultaneously. The software drivers only allow the simultaneous use of channels 1&2 (mic inputs), OR 3&4 (single SPDIF input), OR something called ""Main."" If you choose to use the ""Main"" input you can mix together channels 1&2 with channels 3&4 before the signals are sent to your DAW software, but you still are recording only 2 discrete channels at one time. More disappointing than the limitation is how much research it took to figure out that the limitation exists. Roland doesn't seem to want us to know that the Quad-Capture is truly a two-channel device. As a two-channel device, it is excellent.",3.0

Update: This guitar is still going strong. He's had to replace the strings once.  He practices daily, sometimes for hours, and he's even been in a few local concerts. The sound is pretty good, especially considering the price.  We are looking at upgrading the amp now to one that has an additional outlet for a microphone.

"Did not buy yet... but but am about to as a Christmas present.

My son(16) and I checked this out at a local Guitar Center.  We also looked at all the other comparably priced keyboards(<$400, even ones with weighted keys) from other manufacturers...  This is the one he liked best. Though he learned to play on a real piano, he liked the feel of the WK6600. But, what I think he liked best is the amount of sounds and features this keyboard has. I certainly can't wait to ""borrow"" it from him to add a few keyboard tracks to some stuff I've been working on.

At this price (I've done A LOT of searching), I can't find anything I'd rather have. So many things to like about it... My favorite thing is the line(s) out. A rare find at this price.

Do yourself a favor though and don't base your purchase decision on the reviews here. Get to your local music store and test a few. I'm glad I did. My head was spinning trying to decide what to get based on reviews here on Amazon.

Guitar Center(USA) sells just the keyboard for $299. I will buy this for $329.99 on Amazon. I figure the for an extra $30, the headphones, stand, ac adapter and cover are worth it (probably $60 if ordered individually) since I will need them anyway.

"Really loved this thing. Ive got a Nash Tele that I really like, and I wanted to have another tone option. Plenty of videos out there illustrating this, but its a very useable and good sounding variation from the tonal palate of the three standard pickup selection.

For my sceario on this guitar with lollar pickups, the tone knob is kind of touchy. Its pretty easy to turn it just a tiny touch too far and quickly go from nicely darkened to just too dead sounding. It would be nicer if this was smoother, but I reason that the way it responds probably reacts to the pickups and other variables.  Regardless, still 100 percent happy.",5.0

"Arrived and box was in good shape. The cello itself was protected well by the hard case. My Bridge came setup, and the sound post was in the right place. Also: the bridge was setup perfectly and strings are at the right height. The tailpiece had Styrofoam under it to protect it and the cello.

Fit and finish of the cello is nearly perfect (the varnish was ""hastily"" applied, the wood working was flawless.) The fingerboard was perfectly smooth. Very ""sturdy"" feel, heavier than I expected (in a good way.) The inside of the cellos is FLAWLESS (says a lot about the manufacturing process.) All fine tuners and everything work perfectly. The pegs just WORKED. No slip and came up to pitch without a problem.

It sounds.. stunning. Even with the ""not good"" strings these come with (seem great to me!) .. It's hard to describe: ring-y and sparky up high, mellow and rich in the middle and DEEP and FULL in the lower register. And I'm horrible: I can't imagine what a real cello player could pull from this.

I had one problem: the bow was twisted and overly tight. Big points for the shipper as they've promised to send me a replacement.

Honestly, I don't know how you could go wrong with this package. Yes they are made in a factory in China. But that guy cutting F-holes? He cuts 600 a day. How good do you think he is at it? (I'm guessing but you get the picture.) They are skilled at their craft and have pride in their workmanship: it shows in this product.

I looked at a lot of options before deciding on this cello. I wanted something that I could play for years without worrying about the fingerboard or peg box (or whatever) having issues, and the fittings on this mean that the slightly higher price of entry offers a much better long term investment. I figured it will be years and years before I could benefit from a better cello, but after hearing this I don't think I'll ever be as good as it sounds. Renting was never an option for me as I'm very far from any place that would rent them. I'm very glad I purchased this instead.

Many thanks to Cecilio, KKMusic, Amazon and everyone that had anything to do with the manufacturing process for working so hard and for offering this amazing value.

EDIT: seller followed up and sent a perfect replacement bow just a few days later.",5.0
"The ChordBuddy Guitar Learning system is an excellent package for would be guitarists, even folks who have tried and given up will be pleased at the ease, and simplicity of picking up a guitar, and being able to play right away.  With four major chords, Em, C, G, and D all brought down to just pressing a button to make each Chord.  The guitar, available separately was also a pleasant surprise, as most beginner guitars are difficult to play, with the strings being too far off the fret board, leading to sore fingers, not the case here, you can play with ease, and the sound is amazing compared to other guitars in the beginners range.

With included song books, instructional dvd, and clip on tuner, ChordBuddy will have you playing and singing standards right away.  As your level of playing increases, you simply remove tabs from the Chordbuddy off of the guitar, till you're playing conventionally making the chords on your own.  There is no age limit on learning how to play with the ChordBuddy, Travis Perry has made music easy for all ages to learn.

As an experienced musician, I learned the old fashioned way, mostly self taught, but would have been light years ahead had this been available to me way back when.  There's even a Chord Buddy Jr for ages 4-8 for aspiring young guitarists.

"Personally speaking, this is one of the better band related purchases that I've ever made... I've been looking for something that I could use to speed up my setup/tear down time and this little jewel cut it literally in half. Being a rhythm guitarist and vocalist, I was having to run three 50' XLR cables to our 24 channel snake, routing them in precarious locations that would later lead them to be tangled up with everyone else's cables by the end of the night. That made for a HUGE cluster of knots and entanglements the first time someone took the easy route and grabbed their cables after a show and started snatching them up and out from under the drummers carpet without taking the time to separate theirs from the others before doing so. Trust me, when you have 5 folks snatching and grabbing, trying to GTFO of a venue at the end of the night, no one wants to take the time to untangle a bunch of knots. Now all I have to do is drop the box behind my cabinet, stretch out the 30' XSPRO cable, plug the channels I'm using in to the main snake, run a vocal XLR, and two 6' XLR's, (one from my Sennheiser E609 cab mic and the other from my wireless acoustic receiver) and plug them in to the XSPRO box, and I'm ready for sound check. No more waiting on someone else to get their cables hooked up or, at the end of the night, out of the way. Now I'm rolling up a 30' snake, a 25' vocal XLR, and two 6' instrument XLR cables, and I'm done, with the exception of breaking down my rig. With the 6/30, I have room for any band member playing near me to use any of my unused channels,which would also end up saving them time and stage clutter as well. It was the perfect solution for my needs.

  As far as performance, I've not had my XSPro 6/30 long enough to vouch for its longevity, but judging by it's sturdy build and quality components, I don't foresee having any issues with it any time soon. Of course, unlike some folks, I tend to take a little better care of my equipment as it's pretty hard to come by.
  The first thing that I noticed when I removed the XSPRO from the packaging and protective nylon coverings was how solid the box was. For the price I paid (around $50), I was expecting a cheapo plastic or light gauge metal. WRONG! This thing is REALLY solid. I can't think of anything to compare the thickness of the metal to, but guessing, I'd say it's probably 1/16"" or so. The locking XLR connectors seem to be top of the line and my XLR cables fit with just a tad bit of wiggle room, but firmly lock into place once plugged in. The XLR connectors used on the box have tabs that you push to unlock to release the XLR cable. I tried all channels and they work flawlessly, both mechanically and electronically.

  I guess I'll end this by saying, if you're looking for something to decrease stage clutter and speed up your setup & tear down times, the XSPRO to fit your channel needs would be a good place to start.

"I use this with my Macbook Pro when recording or just fooling around. Right now I'm using Garageband's built in trickery, which yields just a bit of digital fizz at high gain but overall sounds good.

"This adapter worked perfectly from the first instant I plugged it in. I am using it between my TrapKat and SPD-S and my laptop and desktop PC (with Windows 7 SP1 64 bit & XP SP3 64 bit, respectively) to access MIDI-controlled Native Instruments virtual instruments, Addictive Drums 2, EZ Drummer, etc, all kinds of sounds and samples, as well as recording MIDI events into tracks within Sony Acid Pro DAW software. The cable is long enough to go over, under, around, and through many ""obstacles"" on its way to and from its sources and destinations and has deep plugs. Anyone who has experienced short plugs will appreciate this, as these plugs sink deeply into the MIDI sockets on any MIDI instrument/sound module, virtually eliminating any unwanted disconnections.
The only strange thing is that, exactly like the one I used to have, you need to plug the cable marked ""IN"" into the MIDI OUT port of your controller/source, and, if using the MIDI plug at the other end (versus USB), you have to plug the one marked ""OUT"" into the MIDI IN port! I'm glad that I remembered this, since this cable did not come with any instructions, and, unlike a regular MIDI cord, the ends really are different.
With the fantastic price and quick shipment, it's a good product that I would highly recommend.",5.0

"I bought the Samson Go Mic (Titanium black, of course) and it works great for podcasting and Skype but I wanted a quick and easy way to write songs and try out new material with just an acoustic guitar and vocals to give me an idea how it would sound live. So I bought a  Samson G-Track USB mic with Audio Interface (Titanium black, of course) and it is excellent! It comes with Sonar LE recording software but I use Audacity and no problem there, just plug it in and it shows up as an audio device. There is a switch on the side that changes modes from stereo interface to mic/instrument so I used that, plugged in my acoustic, got some levels and hit record. I cant believe the quality for the money and it even came with a desk stand and all the cables.  Its a pretty hot mic and a good idea to get the shock mount accessory.",5.0

"Works great with an amp, pre-amp and power strip in it. They give you ample screws (with insulating washers) front and back. The lids and latches align perfectly and construction is robust for the weight. The handles are comfortable. The only negative is that they use nut strips which are not clipped to the case - they are only held in place by the mounting screws, so you have to be careful to always have at least one screw engaged on each side when swapping or rearranging rack components. If you take all units out at once the nut strips fall off. Try not to let this happen on a dark stage during a gig. Gator could fix this with some simple clips that would still allow the nut strips to float for alignment.",4.0

I was initially satisfied with the sound and play but very disappointed with the look of it.  Now I discovered this instrument also has a vibrating C string which is quite annoying.  Very disappointed with it and being in Australia it would be a hassle to send it back.  Expensive for what it is. I now realise that it is not wise to buy an instrument online.  Buyers beware.",1.0

"So now that I've gone through Aprox 6 sets of these I feel it's time to let ya'll now how great these strings are. Ive started with elixir from my first guitar which was a takamini jasmine, a very cheap guitar but bulletproof, the strings definitely worked very good and lasted a long time.  After that I got a Taylor 110 one of the most beautiful sounding guitars ever, and I've been trying lots of different companies for my strings from ernie ball, to fender. The ernie balls where terrible! The earth woods I think it was, sounded bad, felt even worse, and lasted a week before the rusted to the point of unplayable. And any other strings I tried just never could match the elixirs. I have bad piss fingers, meaning I rust any metal I tough even stainless steel, but with the nanotechnology coating on the strings they last a looongg time and sound great throughout. Super full and bright, and just really happy sounding on the Taylor. They also do great with open tunings. For the feel, they are super, very slippy and aren't harsh on the fingers, of corse if your new yeah they get some calloses going, but compared to some other strings, top notch.
I will be sticking with these for a long time, unless I discover a better brand, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.",5.0

"THE BAD: Well, it's not vinyl. That's what I'm used to. The much smaller circumference makes scratching a lot more challenging and I find myself accidentally touching the top of the platter rather than the side when trying to shift the song ahead or slow it down. Even tapping it for a fraction of a second by accident will pause the song for that long and it really messed with manual mixing.

Another problem may be related to the device or
Maybe the software. If I've hit the devices sync button and it's not perfectly locked on, I'll move the fader but the fader doesn't actually effect the software fader until the device fader is moved into the position of the softwares fader.

Another problem: when using headphones, if I start fading into the next song from deck 1 to 2, I'll usually want to set my headphones to the ""Master"" output to hear how the fade in sounds. And sometimes I'll want to cut the fader back to deck 1 only again. Sometimes I like to fade in slowly but cut the new song out at certain measures. When I do this, the mixer automatically changes my headphones to hear ONLY deck 1 and I need to once again manually hit the master button so I can hear the headphones. Is this a software issue?

Last issue: there is no real manual or tutorial anywhere in regards to setting this thing up. There's a bit on Serato but I've never been able to get it to work with the brief info the give. And there is NO info on setting it up with DJPro which I use. So  all of these above problems could be software related but I have no way of knowing and no way of fixing it.

THE GOOD: Those cheap plastic faders are actually SUPER BUTTERY SMOOTH. More so than any real mixer I've owned - a couple Stantons and Gemini's. The speed sliders are just as smooth which feels almost TOO fast compared to the Tech 12 sliders I'm used to.

"The Etymotic ER-4P/PT are high-quality, audiophile-grade IEMs (in-ear monitors) with a more accurate and defined sound stage than many other more expensive IEMs, e.g. Shure SE530/535, Westone 4/4R, Triple. Fi 10 Pro, Sennheiser IE80. The only difference between the P and PT versions is that the PT comes with a compliance graph and some slightly different tips -- they're intended for professional use, while the ER-4P are intended for personal use.

These IEMs have exceptional mids and highs. While some find the bass lacking, I believe it is very precise. If you are concerned about the bass, I would suggest either opting for the ER-4S/B or buying new so that you can return them if needed.

One disclaimer worth noting, especially if these are your first IEMs is to try out the different ear tips even if the first ones fit well because the bass can vary depending on the tips used. It will also take some adjustment time to get used to the lows, as well as how the sound is reproduced with your body movement.",4.0

These flanges provide excellent noise isolation and a firm secure fit for the E5 phones. My old ones (which I got from Shure for $12 / pair) had gotten floppy and loose over time and eventually one fell off in Paris and was lost forever in the Seine. These are a great deal. They fit well and work as well as the more expensive originals. The only downside was that the shipping seemed expensive for something that weighs less than an ounce.

"The Texas Special pickups I received to replace the stock Stratocaster pickups were noticibly different in appearance right out of the box.  The stock pickup windings are copper in color and the Texas Special windings are dark brown.

I de-soldered the original pickups and re-soldered the Texas Specials following the instructions included in the packaging.  The installation went without a hitch and frankly was easier that I had expected.  I had a little trouble with my old soldering gun since it did not want to heatup to the temperature the solder required.  But, after waiting a while the old gun started working and I was on my way.

After installing the new Texas Specials I went back with a medium weight set of DAddario strings.  To be honest I really don't hear a huge difference in sound during recording using headphones.  It is only after plugging into my old Gibson tube amp and cranking up the volume that you can begin to hear a little deeper growl from the pickups.

I was not impressed with these pickups and would advise prospective buyers to shop around before spending $140.00 on the Texas Specials.

"When you buy Behringer, you pretty much know what you're getting into.  They could just as well rename their brand ""3 Out Of 5 Stars Audio Equipment"".  This little amp does what it says, and its a nice cheap way to amplify up to 4 pairs of headphones.  I have to watch how strong of an input signal I feed this unit because it clips at higher input gains.  I noticed last night that it also distorts when driven too hard, but I was really pushing the level knobs into ear-shredding territory.

"Don't let ""6-inch"" fool you, these are not small pop-filters. These will cover more than just the diameter of a typical microphone. In our studio, we frequently have to adjust ourselves, our laptops or the filters themselves so we have a clear line of sight to whatever we're focusing on. It's not a huge problem, but it is something to keep in mind. These are large 6-inch filters, which is way larger than the 2-inch diameter microphone that it will probably cover.

That said, these are pretty study. The necks are sometimes loose, but it just requires a little fiddling to get it in place and to stay that way. There is a metal clip with a rubbery-clamp that can attach to a boom. The filter screen itself can adjust off-center too from the neck. The fabric is a black nylon (or something similar to it) and is double sided (two layers). The fabric does not wrap around the outside of the ring, it loops around a ring that is embedded into the outer ring making the fabric have no visible seams.

Overall, if you're looking for great general purpose pop-filters and don't mind looking over or below them to see the stuff on the table, these are great.",4.0

Love it. I bought 2 of these for my studio. It was definitely an over kill since these things are extremely loud. So crisp and clear. I even DJ parties with these since they are better sounding than PA systems and just as loud.,5.0

"Replaced the stock strings on a Fender DG-60 acoustic guitar and immediately could hear an improvement in the overall sound of the guitar. The strings are not silent as you move your fingers up and down them but they make considerably less noise than the factory strings. These strings appear to be a strong value especially if they hold up for a few months before changing their sound.

Overall at this point I would recommend the strings and would buy them again in the future.",5.0
"I've had these for a couple months now and I can't really complain.  The volume is slightly limited but the range is nice and I feel like they do give you an accurate feel for the sound mix.  Seeing as they are some of the most inexpensive monitors available I expected less and was impressed.

It seems like most of the reviewers here are using them as speakers, which I personally think is a waste.  If you are just looking to find good speakers to watch movies and listen to music on your computer you'd probably be much better off looking for a good set of computer speakers, which will cost the same if not less.  I mean at that point your definately not going to be taking advantage of the 1/4 inch inputs and that's one of the reason that these cost more than computer speakers.",4.0
Arrived on time and just perfect!,5.0

"Sorry, but this Shubb needs work! It has too much curvature for the thickness of the sleeve. I had to flatten it a bit with a mallet to get it close with the sleeve that's not as thick/effective as the std DeLuxe model. I wasted my money",2.0
"A note to reviewers: your reviews are more useful if you specify which seller you bought the product from. Mine was ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"".

Where to start...
 It has a loud fan. Might not be such a problem if it were a  sound, but it whirs up and down and sounds like it's going to expire at any moment. Very annoying.
 Unlike with other ""magic globe""-style lights, the faceted dome does not rotate. Instead, the circuit board holding the LEDs is attached to a stepper motor which swings back & forth. The effect is unpleasant at best. Also, the cheap motor binds and moves erratically (or not at all), making the display even more unpleasant.
 The wires that go to the LEDs loop over them, so they cast a shadow as the PCB jerks around (I won't dignify the motion by calling it ""rotation""). This was unnecessary since the motor only rotates about 180, so it's just sloppy construction.
 The light patterns are just blinky, flashy, and irritating. There is no subtlety here.
 I never did get the ""music control"" (the reason I bought this globe) to work, even after a lot of experimentation, though perhaps more meaningful instructions would help. Actually, I shouldn't dignify that piece of paper by calling it ""instructions"".

I didn't really expect much from this cheap Chinese toy, and figured that if it didn't work I'd scrounge parts from it to build something better. Well, it isn't even good even for that (mostly because the dome doesn't rotate). So, back it goes. This is sold by Amazon ""exclusively for Prime members"". In this case, I'd say that non-Prime members are the lucky ones.

If you want something like this (and don't need ""music control"" or DMX), I'd recommend this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLVOQB6. So far I've bought 15 of them from Amazon, and while they also have some QC issues (somewhat jerky rotation, mostly) they're nowhere  as bad as this ""Econoled"" thing. The display is far more pleasant, and it's much, much quieter. It's also <1/2 the price.",2.0
Love the built in effects it has a great sound for a small practice amp. Very happy with it.,5.0

"Great little amp especially for $20. Won't compete or replace any actual amps but it is very fun and will definitely serve you if you are looking for a travel amp. Use it to play with my mini stratocaster, so this combo was inexpensive and sound great! Of course it really depends on your skill level",5.0
"Damn thing is loud!  Too loud to turn up full without disturbing the locals, on the other side of the wall.  Thought it would be tinny and weak..  So, turn up the drive or gain, and it has a really sweet sound, too good to be true.
Can't get a charger that'll fit - have one more to order that gives an EXACT fit re ohms and all, maybe it'll work.  But the batteries seem to last forever anyway..
Wish they would make an Amp just like this about 20 times the wattage and with a 12 inch speaker.  Really fun to play.  Have a 100 Watt Ampeg tube amp and it is impressive but doesn't have that sweet sound, and the easy push towards breakup of this little guy.",5.0

Very finicky with input power. Says it has a wide range up to 5.5v? Not a chance. Won't work with a Naze32 flight controller with 5.2v. Tried two sticks on two different fc boards so far and now I have to return them both.,2.0
"My Line 6 Spider has a lot of usable tones but lacks the clean sound of a Fender clean tube amp IMHO. The pedal does just that. The Voice knob will take it from clean to a HotRod bluesy type overdrive. The Drive knob will add a lot of overdrive. For me this is perfect for the clean sound that makes my Tele sound like a Tele. If you're considering upgrading to a tube amp, this might be your answer.",5.0

"My son's drum instructor suggested this set for a beginner set.  It really is the best bang for your buck.  Yes, there are some other cheaper sets on Amazon, but for $50 more this set is well worth it. Save yourself some shopping time and order this.
It took my hubby abut 1hr to put together.  We had to play around with tightening the drums so that they didn't rattle.  Also, there is no hole in the base drum so we did cut a hole and put a pillow in there.  Happy drumming!!

My son still loves this set.  Thought I'd post the other items that I purchased to accompany it.

"PROS:
- Good quality for the price.
- Size is not too big, yet not too small.
- Comfortable feel and form-factor.
- Nice sound, and good for beginners.
- Finish on bongos are very high-grade.

TIPS:
- Look up bongo tuning videos, regardless of your expertise level of the instrument
- There are many, many videos online to teach you how to play the bongos, so don't be discouraged

SUMMARY:
These bongos were a christmas gift and they were a great gift at that! The finish on these bongos are simply amazing and smooth. I feel as if the quality of these bongos are great. The top of the drum as well as the metal surrounding the bongo itself have a great feel and seem very strong. The feeling of it on the lap is great, and not too heavy. The size of the bongos are perfect, you can stow these away in a closet or display them without taking as much space as full sized bongos. There are also  a plethora of instructional bongo videos, although its pretty simple as banging on these guys with your hands. Even if you are a beginner it's always nice to have a nicely tuned bongo, just like a finely tuned guitar. The process is fun if you're into the learning process of instruments. I also feel on a side note, this may be a good quality drum for a younger child. Due to the sturdiness of these bongos, I feel as if they will last longer than a play set bought for their age.",4.0
"I purchased this product as an upgrade from a Korg nanokey.  I started with the nanokey to see if MIDI boards would be something I would be interested in.  I bought this as an upgrade and currently use it through both Reason and FL Studio.  Both recognized the board automatically and was quick to setup.  I am not a piano player, so I can't give to many comparisons as how it is compared to playing an actual piano, however it is responsive and easy enough to play.  The sliders, buttons and knobs come in handy for controlling various aspects of a DAW and definitely help streamline music production.  All construction is lightweight but durable.  Very lightweight considering its size.
For its price This is a great MIDI board, however keep in mind that it doesn't come with any software; so I would suggest looking into a DAW or already have one before buying this board.",4.0

"It sounds really great, I replaced the stock tube in my micro terror and the first thing I noticed was less gain, less volume but a lot more bass and warmth. It sounds a lot more tube-like now than with the original tube which i thought sounded too digital, harsh and fuzzy. Playing a Jazzmaster - micro terror - engater tweaker 1x12.

"Sounds great, affordable, and is easy to hold",5.0
As with most of the reviews the assembly is the biggest challenge.  My advice:  Get a drummer to assemlbe it.  Tunning the heads and configuring the set correctly will make for a much happier little drummer and will benefit anyone having to listen.  Have them check that all the lugs are scewed in tight to the shells before putting the heads on or you may end up with more than one snare.  Speaking of the snare.  It is easily the week point of the kit.  I was very impressed with the High hat and Crash cymbal quality.  Overall a great little kit especially given the price. It can take a load of abuse and doesn't sound half bad (especially with earplugs in),4.0

"I think this package is a great idea. It's generally hard to buy less that 10 reeds, so getting to try 4 different reeds in a package is great. Each reed has it's own characteristics, and others have given their opinions in reviews, but I think we can all decide for ourselves based on our expertise and favorite style of play. I happen to like the V16 and green best, quite a different opinion than some other reviews. Just personal taste...
In terms of what strength of reed to purchase a couple of notes for those who haven't tried different reed styles and brands. These Van Doren reeds are all ""weaker"" than their Traditional reed, so if you play a 3 strength Van Doren Traditional these Jazz reeds are rated closer to 2.5 for most, and maybe 2.75 for the V16.
If you've only played on a Rico standard reed, it's noticeably weaker than all the Van Dorens, so make sure not to order too high a strength number. Various sites include strength comparisons between brand and style, including SaxPlus, Rico, and Van Doren sites.",5.0
"These are one of the most comfortable and best sounding headphones I have used to this date.
In terms of sound signature, these are very flat, and sound natural. They also sound warmer than some of the other open headphones I have used in the past like Sony MA900, and Fidelio X2. These reminded me of Sennheiser HD 650 but I like these better. Very easy to listen to, yet they don't lack any detail. The only downsides would be, like most other open headphones, these do seem to lack a little bit of bass and they do require some serious amping/DAC because they have 470 impedance.
I really wish I could give these headphones 5/5 but their design and finishing are a lot worse than I have expected, especially for its price range.

I've only had this wireless lavalier microphone system for a week but can say it is excellent and met my expectations. I have not encountered the hissing or pops some people are writing about and am getting good clean audible audio in my test recordings.

"I recently purchased this guitar sight unseen.  After extensively searching online for a acoustic guitar I decided to bite the bullet and order this from Sam Ash ie Amazon.  There was only one of these available to ship on the continent. Sweetwater was where I was going to buy but they weren't available yet.  The guitar arrived yesterday and with great apprehension I opened up the case and took all the padding off. I couldn't believe how beautiful it looked. I cannot find one flaw on it. The sound is to die for. The sustain and playability right out of the box is superb. I'm so happy all the work studying and reviewing payed off. I would highly recommend this guitar. No need to spend 3 or 4 thousand dollars on a Martin, Taylor,  Larrivee etc. All I can say is WOW. I  have other Yamahas and love each one. Impeccable workmanship.

"Okay, so I've read a lot of opinions on this new ES-Les Paul - mostly from people who haven't actually PLAYED it.  Comments range from the completely inane to just plain uninformed.  Well I have played it and not just in a Guitar Center store with whatever amps they have available.  I have played it in the home studio of a friend who boasts classic hand wired tube amps from Fender, Marshall, Orange and Mesa, as well as VOS LP 56, 58, 59 and dozens of others.  The truth is that you are only going to realize the full potential of this instrument with this calibur of rig.

I can tell you with absolute certainty that this new ES Memphis/Nashville love child deserves a spot at the top along side the best VOS' Gibson has produced.  There simply isn't anything out there from any manufacturer that can pull of the range and versatility and supreme tone that this one does.  And I am including ANY VOS you may wish to stack up against it.  You will get the supreme overdrive, bite and sustain you are accustomed to in top tier LP's, but with a mere roll back of the volume knob you WILL get the ES-335 hollow body sound.  I don't mean close to it, you WILL get it!  This guitar is truly what they say it is.  An LP and a 335 all in one package.  My friend has well over $100,000 in vintage instruments (mostly guitars), all of which are vaunted classics for good reason.  I say this not to boast, but instead to demonstrate that we have the ability to easily A/B any of these fine instruments.  His favorite WAS the VOS 56 LP.  Key word, WAS!  This ES LP has gone instantly to the head of the class for him and I agree completely.

Fit, finish, set up and balance are spectacular, not just great.  And with the ability to go from AUTHENTIC classic Jimmy Page rock bite to vintage correct jazz or blues tones, there may not be a more versatile AND top quality tone machine in the world coming off a production line.  What amazed me more than anything is how you can make this axe go from dirt to clean merely by adjusting your pick attack.  Certain of the VOS ilk have that quality, but not to the extent that this guitar does.  I have never played a stock guitar with more tone versatility simply by adjusting your pick attack.  At $2,900 I firmly believe it is seriously underpriced when compared to the price points of the VOS line.  I fully expect the retail cost of this guitar to significantly increase in the coming year or so.

"I was just looking around on Amazon like I do and this Yellow Les Paul from Epiphone popped up and I had never played a guitar with P-90's on it so...I got it quick, opened it up and it's really nice just like every Epiphone I ever bought.  2 twelve strings, a Les Paul Jr., an SG special and now the Les Paul Special with P-90's...perfect.  The single coil sound of the P-90's is very unique and it's another new sound for me and my music...love it.",5.0

"Not a review about the actual sound of the pedal, just about the inverted, glow-in-the-dark paint job. Love the paint job. It glows beautifully (though it requires a large amount of light to really get glowing). Chicago Music Exchange handled my order quickly and with no problems. It's the same cost of the regular pedal and it's a limited run. I can't think of any reason not to get this one if you're going to get the Afterneath anyways.",5.0
"These are great for the price and availability. I've got some Alesis monitors and the left and right fit is perfect. They are deeper than I need, but no big deal.

"If you use a felt pick, go ahead and get these.  In a music store they may or may not have these in stock, and if they do, the price will be too much and the quantity will probably fall short.  These are great for ukuleles, although there are uke purists who only use fingers.  I use these with the plastic thumb picks to make a hybrid.  Good luck.
And sometime later...for those who say they are too stiff, lay the pick flat, then raise it just a bit, then gently rub the pointed end across a piece of rough sandpaper until the tip is a bit thinner, then do the other side.  Just do a little at a time, strum a bit, rub a bit more.  You'll end up with a softer, more pliable pick.  And if you ruin one, that's why they come in a dozen pack!",5.0
"I really loved this guitar. bought it with the idea to change pickups on it but never got around to that. Sounded good, but weak, especially for metal or shred. New pickups would be a must. Guitar looks awesome AF! The strings feel a bit dull or stiff, but maybe new strings will fix that and some adjustments. I moved on from this guitar though and is just sitting there but I plan to get some new strings and a fresh re-set up along with new pups on it. For a first guitar, you can't go wrong for this price. If you own more expensive guitars, I would get it only if you're getting it for looks and plan on changing the pickups cause in stock, you wouldn't find anything new on this cheap guitar that you probably already have on your higher end models. Pretty solid cool guitar for practice and looks, and awesome deal for beginners. I would give it a 5 but that would mislead people into thinking that it's an awesome high end guitar at a steal. I however do think it sounds like it's worth around $250-$300. Put in some good pickups and you have yourself a solid intermediate guitar... I would imagine.. since I haven't dropped in some new pups myself yet.",4.0

"This is a great case! The case looks solid and well made. I haven't noticed any of the issues others have had with it. All the buckles line up and the strap seems to attach securely. The color of the burlap is slightly lighter than it appears in the photo. The blue velvet lining is soft with nice thick padding underneath, and absolutely gorgeous! Overall I love the vintage look of it.

It fits my Moku Tenor 85 Uke perfectly, like if it was made for it. I tried to buy a case at a local brick and mortar store, but the case they had was too big. I actually bought this through the Guitar Center site because I was concerned about the sizing, and they offer easy in-store returns so i didn't have to worry about the hassle of return shipping had it not fit.

Bottom line: this is a solidly built, stylish-looking case, good value for the price. A big thumbs up! Love this case!",5.0

I did the A/B test by mic'ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic's in the very same positions. I would recommend for sure.

Sounds amazing! I have yet to find the holly grail of headphones though. Again I had amazingly high expectations due to videos on youtube and reviews. Maybe they don't exist. Holly grail meaning (cheap and amazeballs). Now for the price these are incredible and I don't feel cheated nor that I wasted my money. I would recommend to anyone looking for headphones in any price range as these do the trick. I had some cheap senheizers once that lasted forever and where very good as well. (they stopped making them). I would think these are a bit better. But both are great. BUY THESE. Not five stars because I believe 5 stars should be headphones that make my ears feel as if they where the most special thing in the planet and they have extremely high standards.,4.0

"Joined a band recently and their practice kit had the s***tiest bass drum spurs ever.

"I needed to capture acoustic piano, pipe organ and voices with good fidelity and minimum fuss - quick placement on a table, stand or tripod, and easy operation without searching through menus.  Other needs: good mic sensitivity with ability to handle reasonable signal overloads, fast searching through files for rehearsal details and easy WAV/MP3 file transfer to a computer.

The DR07 exceeded my expectations.  All of the buttons and dials needed for recording, playback and searching are on the front or side of the case.  Basic operation is very much like using an analog mini-cassette voice recorder.

With a new piece of equipment I like to see how far I can go with its operation before consulting the manual.  I finally cracked the book to find out how to split and transfer files, set recording delays and create playlists.  Most of the default settings were exactly what I needed.

This unit has features I probably won't use: looping, track repeats and ID3 tag info on MP3 files, for example. I will, however, use the pitch, tuning and speed adjustments - features I only dreamed of not too many years ago.

I suppose it's possible there are slight digital artifacts, barely hissy pre-amps or some pumping if you use the level limiter, but the overall sound is far more than adequate for 'field recordings'.

I respectfully suggest that if you hope to capture polished CD quality recordings from a $110 recorder with built-in mics, maybe you're expecting too much.

For anyone else who wants very good recording quality and ease of use in a small, inexpensive package, I honestly can't see how you can fault this piece of equipment.

One final note:  I also wanted a speaker so others could monitor recordings with me.  Since the DR07 does not have a built-in speaker, I bought the Altec Lansing iM237 battery operated speaker to run from the DR07's headphone/line out jack when I wasn't using headphones/ear buds.  Its sound is much better than the built-in speakers on more expensive portable recorders.  The iM237 comes with a case and easily fits in a pocket of my gig bag with the recorder.

November, 2014:  I'm still using the DR-07 but wanted to add a better microphone.  After much research I settled on the Audio-Technica AT822 X/Y battery-powered condenser microphone.  It's the predecessor to the AT8022 but the main difference is lack of a phantom power option which I didn't need.  Used or old stock AT822s are readily available on Ebay.  The improvement in recording quality with the AT822 is pretty impressive: far better clarity, depth, warmth and sensitivity.",5.0

"This is pretty much the usual Aebersold - chord changes and heads, and a CD to practice with.  Unlike some other volumes such as Maiden Voyage and Killer Joe, this probably isn't aimed at beginners - there's a lot less guidance about scales and chord tones to use over the changes, and the changes themselves are a little more sophisticated, at least for some of the tunes.  I'm confused by other reviewers claiming that there's no bass part for ""So What"" - if they are talking about the melody for the head, traditionally played by the bass, yep, it's in there - page 29, take another look.  I agree that it's odd to leave out the second ending for ""Freddie Freeloader"" - it's not really a problem for soloing (where one traditionally sticks to the first ending anyway), but it definitely makes the head incorrect.  Otherwise, I haven't noticed any egregious errors (though I won't swear to have looked through it with a fine-toothed comb yet).  Certainly worth buying if you want to play some classic Miles, esp. with a CD to back you.",4.0

"I've been using this speaker as a vocal foldback speaker on stage while I play acoustic drums. It has plenty of volume for this purpose, and having easy access to the volume and tone controls is great. The sound quality is very hi-fi, with plenty of highs and lows. I've also used it as a keyboard amp, and even as a practice bass guitar amp. At home I use it to play backing tracks while I practice acoustic drums.

A couple of features that haven't really been mentioned in the other reviews:

Both inputs have stereo (TRS) sockets, which are internally mixed to mono, so there's no need to set up a mono mix on your drum module - just use a stereo TRS cable. A headphone output is ideal.
Mono guitar leads also work, but then you will miss one side of stereo, but you could use two mono cables into the two inputs.
Note: balanced jack signals from a mixer won't work, because the + and - signals get combined and cancel each other. Just use a standard guitar lead from a balanced output..

The first input has a bass and treble boost built in, to emphasize kick and hihat frequencies. A bit like a 'loudness' control on a home stereo. The second input is 'flat' which is the one I use for my vocal foldback, because it sounds more natural.
If you are running out of volume, the second input has more headroom because it doesn't try to boost the bass as much.

The bass and treble controls work well and affect both inputs, which can be limiting, but this is the same as similar amps and powered speakers.
There are no output jacks at all, so you'll need a DI box or two to send signals to a PA system. No headphone socket either.

I bought mine secondhand, and have used it for around 100 gigs over 4 years, and the build quality is excellent. No issues at all.
Highly recommended.",5.0

It is fun to play, requires only light pressing on the hands, yet, even though it can be played by a non-musician, and will sound great in the hands of a beginner, there is still a learning curve and that which is practiced will bring about great results.

"22.8.15
I fitted Ernie Ball Aluminum Bronze (12s) to my Gibson J45 and played them in for an hour before setting off for a gig. They sounded great acoustically and amplified. Enhanced lows, punchy mids, crisp highs, more projection etc; all true. 45 minutes into a two hour set the A string (44) broke at the bridge. After changing it for a spare Rotosound I continued. Two songs later the D string (32) broke (at the bridge again). Rather than stop again I carried on with five strings to get through the song. Within seconds the G string (24) broke (at the bridge again). The gig had gone from embarrassing to painful. Before anyone suggests that theres something wrong with my bridge, there isnt. Ive played the J45 for about eight months and restrung it about six times. Ive tried a few different manufacturers and gauges to find out which suits the guitar best. I hadnt broken a string until that night then broke three in less than two hours playing.
They sounded brilliant and gave the guitar a new range of tones I was keen to explore but if they don't get through a gig they're useless. I have no confidence in them and won't be buying any more. So, five stars for sound and playability, zero for gig-ability.",1.0

One thing I like is although it's meant to replicate an Ibanez style headstock, it's slightly more accentuated and a bit better looking in my opinion, which is perfect for the project I'm doing with an old RG120 body. The frets feel nice and the overall neck is good quality.

The actual main reason I ordered this neck is I ordered one coming from China back in November and it still hasn't come in yet. Tracking indicates it hasn't even left the shipping facility yet. I should have received it by now, although it's still within the estimated delivery window. So I grew impatient and decided to order this one yesterday and I received it today (props to Amazon Prime), and I'm glad I did. Not sure of the quality of the first one I ordered that I'm still waiting on but this one is great.",5.0

"Very nice strap. Unlike suede straps it moves with you which is nice but not too slippery that it allows your acoustic to slip and do a nose dive (common with nylon straps).  I also bought the W&W Strap Extender Black which extends the length to 60"" (I like mine at about 58"" for my acoustic guitars, so out of the box this one wasn't long enough but I knew that going in since the length is advertised).  I don't sling my acoustic low like the Ramones or anything but without the extender it was a couple inches higher than what I normally like.  I bought the brown strap also and one thing to note, both straps had a chemical smell to them when I opened them out of the plastic wrap they are shipped in (not a nice leathery smell as I was expecting). After a few days it wasn't as bad  but eventually I wiped them down with some leather cleaner/conditioner and that did the trick.  So one star off for the smell, but it's fixable.",4.0

"The Cecilio CVN-300 is definitely a beginner's violin, specially if one isn't sure the violin will be something they will take to. It is high enough quality to where it doesn't seem like a toy but too low a quality for the intermediate player. I do question all the youtube videos I've seen, wondering if they are from the makers and sellers of this violin- I suspect they are very biased opinions from folks who just want to sell something. They say this violin has an ebony fingerboard. With some of the paint coming off the fingerboard after a couple of days, I see light wood underneath, I'm suspicious. There were two bows with the violin. Low quality like the violin itself. The metronome does work in all modes- how accurate it is, who knows. I would return it, but balancing cost and quality of anything these days, it's to be expected- I doubt I could get more for the money anywhere else. I gave it three stars since it will work for beginning lessons. To an untrained ear it sounds ok. Good enough to meet my goals of taking beginning lessons. If I take well to the violin, my next purchase will be a more quality purchase.",3.0

"I purchased this through Guitar Center, and couldn't be happier! I read some of the reviews and would like to dispel some of the negatives:
SOME say it is small and hard to wrap around. Yes it is. It is small. Anything bigger would not be able to fit into the airplane cargo bin.
SOME have also complained about the awkwardness of the lap bar and the heavier neck that leaves your guitar unbalanced. I say...  This is easily adaptable. I simply don't use the lap bar, but added a guitar strap instead. Balance issues averted. Yes, I sit and play, & without  the lap bar. However, I can easily get up and move about the room out putting the guitar down as well. Or, I can stand and play.

To date I have taken this little beauty on 2 airline trips, and several car trips. It fits well in the overhead, and the  gig bag straps over my shoulder, very compactly. The tuning is in the body, well protected from bumping. When I arrived at my destinations, I had very little to re-tune, which is a major perk. SOME reviews state that this guitar is too quiet. I say yes, but HIGHLY ADAPTABLE! If you are practicing in a hotel room, cubicle, etc... you WANT to be quiet. I also discovered that you can't hear it very well when the TV is on, or there is talking in the room. Simple fix: With a Vox headphone amp and a pair of headphones, you can practice without being disturbed or disturbing others. All that being said, it does not compare to the sound of a good acoustic guitar. But for travel? Having something to practice scales and riffs? A great tool, and a lot of fun!

SOME say it is still too quiet...It's electric, baby! Plug it in to real amp, and you have a real electric guitar that you can jam with others.  Is your Amp to big for travel ? No problem!  Downsize to a battery operated MINI AMP( the size of your hand)  that clips on a belt & can fit into any bag.
Problem solved.",5.0
"I purchased the Dragonpad pop filter with a Blue Microphones Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone and it's ""okay"". The reason I say this is because when you buy the Snowball alone you get a microphone stand that the Dragonpad doesn't exactly fit well with. The positioning looks very uncomfortable and the pop filter itself tends to lop over on my desk. As for the pop filter itself it's great! It does exactly what I want it to with the exception of fitting on the Snowball. I give this a 4/5 because it does its job but doesn't exactly fit my desk set up.",4.0

"I have a black mahalo as well and it feels way more sturdy and professional than this white rainbow one. It buzzes like crazy and the frets were slightly raised on the edges of the neck so when I was strumming it would tear up my finger. I had to file them down, but they're still a little sharp. I use this as my 'bored at my coffee shop job' ukulele though so I don't care that it's not the best, it still makes music.",3.0
"I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat. What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that. But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before. These are easy to install and simple to use. All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set. As others have pointed out, these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way. It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove. I've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I don't even notice the difference. They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected.",5.0
Just wonderful thank you,5.0
"These are probably the worst picks I've ever used. I've always used and loved Ernie Ball's strings so I figured they would have qaulity picks as well...WRONG! I have used all the different gauges they offer and it only takes about 20 minutes or less of intermediate/hard playing for them to start chipping and breaking. They feel very cheap when you hold and strum/pick with them. Tremolo picking will instantly kill them aswell. It also did not help that they have a slick and slippery surface on them either, not a very good feature! In conclusion stay away from these, get Dunlop or even Fender picks over these things.",1.0

"As a beginning guitar player (in my 50's!), this suits my needs perfectly at a very reasonable price. It holds two 8.5 x 11 in sheets of paper side-by-side for songs I'm learning. It also securely holds the only songbook I own--Justin Sandercoe's Beginner's Songbook (Vol 1, 2nd ed.). At 223 7"" x 10"" pages, I wasn't sure it would work, but the stand holds up to it very well. Of course, that book is spiral-bound (in my mind, essential for all songbooks!), so I can't vouch for how it would work with glue-bound books of a similar size. I don't stand when I play (yet), but I tried out the stand as if my 6' 4"" body was standing to play. Even with legs splayed out as far as they can go (for maximum stability, the stand, at max height, was able to hold sheets of music and the Sandercoe book at a level that was readable for me. Impressive! But please keep in mind, that a relatively small bump with it extended to its full height (or close to it) will knock it over. But at this price, the stand is a great value! Plus, the Crafty Gizmos company followed up my Amazon purchase of their stand with an email asking me if the stand was working well for me and if I had any concerns or suggestions. THAT certainly doesn't happen very often! Thank you Crafty Gizmos!",5.0

"This guitar has more punch than guitars that cost ten times the price!  The look, the feel and the quality of this guitar is unbelievable.  I've been playing rock for over 40 years and I've had PRS, Gibson, Fender, Ibanez and so forth.  This guitar can keep up with them all.  It is light weight and the pickups have guts!  The neck is great and the frets were smooth.  The intonation was so very close that I set this guitar up in about 15 minutes.  It comes with .010 on it and they seem to be quality strings.  The volume and the tone controls work well and don't seem to drastically alter the sound quality like some guitars do.  I play this thru a Roland Blues Cube 80 on the Twin Reverb setting and I am getting some amazingly clear crunch.  I plan on getting another on of these for myself and getting one for a gift for an aspiring family member!  This is one of the best guitars that I have EVER bought.  So if you're a newbie or and experienced player from rock to country to alternative and more this guitar might just simply amaze you!",5.0

"I wanted to like these keys so much! They are small, good-looking, lighted, aftertouch, oh my! Coming from Korg nano and Arturia controller, I had great expectations for these. Unfortunately, they were a major disappointment. Firstly, the keys are made of very unpleasant to touch rubber. Much, much more unpleasant than Korg PadKontrol pads, for instance. Secondly, there is this huge inconsistency between the keys: being struck with approximately same force, different keys produce *wildly* different velocity, and the editor app can't correct this, either (and the app needs a very specific version of Qt runtime, I can't imagine how normal, not geek, people are supposed to figure this out) Also, please note that there is no ""mod wheel"" button! You'll have to wiggle yucky rubber ""keys"" just right for it, and that wiggling motion would have to be carefully balanced against the pressure...

"NOTE: I updated the review from 3 to 4 stars after trying the amp with a few more guitars I have. This little thing really sounds great with some guitars, and really bad with the others, so it could be better to try it with a specific guitar before buying it.

The Good:
It is very cute and very portable, could even fit in the guitar case or in the pocket of a gig bag.
Only tried with headphones and a 8 inch cab, and it does the job for bedroom practice.
Cannot compare with a ""real"" Plexi, never tried one, but it has a great distorted tone with some hot pickups.
On its own not a lot of noise unless at 100% volume and gain, or using some pedals. Not as bad as some other reviewers describe, probably depends on luck and/or specific mix of gear.

The Bad:
This thing doesn't do ""clean"", even with gain at 0. It is always a bit dirty (not always a bad thing).
A bit annoying thump when powered on and off, seem to lack any speaker protection. Not sure if that could damage a cab.

The Ugly:
The biggest issue for me is how difficulty it is to set the EQ to have a decent tone, comparing to every other amp I have. It is quite aggressive, and balance between mid and treble seem a bit off, I always keep the treble below 30% to sound half decent with P90s, Tele single coils, or vintage type humbuckers.",4.0

The only complaint that I would have is it can easily be knocked so be careful. This is a great set for a beginner player just starting out learning.

"First off, I'd like to say that the customer service at Hall Crystal Flutes is five star!

Now on to the product. Having never owned an ocarina, I did a lot of research before making a purchase. I wanted a high quality instrument without having to invest much, and I have to say I made the right choice. Even never having played a wind instrument, this ocarina was very easy to learn fingering and breathing techniques; and I was practicing scales and melodies in no time.

The ocarina is ceramic and can fit in the palm of your hand. The design (mine is the celtic spirals) is elegant and I love the colors. After learning how to control my breath for higher and lower notes, the sound it makes is beautiful and pleasant.

It comes in a box with a small instruction booklet that gives you a scale to practice, techniques such as sliding and trilling, and two songs: Amazing Grace and Skye Boat Song (my only complaint is that there are no indications for rhythm, so your stuck making up your own unless you already know the song which I'm finding very common among ocarina music books).

All in all, you won't be sorry with this purchase. My only recommendations is to 1) buy a music book to go with it and 2) make sure the owner is age appropriate, as in, it IS ceramic and will break if dropped on a hard surface (I myself have dropped it on the carpet and it was fine).",5.0

"I got the uke bug recently when I had decided to bring my grandmothers early 1920's banjolele home from a storage unit we have a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed playing it tho the tone isn't that great from the 7th fret on, & decided to purchase an inexpensive ukulele to relieve the stress I'm experiencing at my part time job right now. Seeing the deal on Amazon for this model,I decided to splurge on myself.(usually don't do that around the holidays) It arrived today and I went about testing it. I love the tone-very sweet and that sweetness carries all the way up to the 12th fret. The neck has a great feel,and the frets are well done-no rough edges or uneveness. No string buzzes,the nut and bridge also being very well made. And it has dots on the side of the neck as well as on the fretboard...yay!! (Soooo important-I'm one of those dot players-I get lost without em.) Very good tone for such an inexpensive instrument. The finish could be a tad better-no glue shows or anything like that,it's just not a high quality finish,but the whole idea of buying this model was to have something I could take to work without worry-and the better the finish,the more I worry,so that met my qualifications as well. I had to tweak the machine heads a bit-one was too tight,one too loose & was easily remedied with a small blade screwdriver to the screw on the back of each tuner. On the picky side,I was hoping the gig bag would have an accessories compartment & shoulder strap,but I can add those myself or carry my tuner & pick in my backpack. The strings are new,and stretch a lot just like those of a classical guitar. (I also play guitar,mandolin,and lap dulcimer) This would make a great first ukulele for a person of any age,or a take along model for those more experienced but wanting a ""what,me worry?"" instrument. Looking forward to playing blues,Irish tunes,1920's songs in addition to classical on it. Right now I'm learning Yuletide carols.",5.0

I bought this and an AT 440 mla for use with my Marantz 6300 TT and Marantz 2230 Receiver. This cartridge sounds great. The AT was more crisp but I had to turn the treble down a couple notches. It sounded very good but I felt like I was listening to a cd. This guy sounds very warm and how I imagined my older stereo system should sound. Everything sounds wonderful. The AT seemed to have less pops than the DL-110 but as long as you keep the stylus clean and your records clean it doesn't seem to be an issue. I highly recommend this and it's priced far less than the AT so that's nice too.,5.0
"Legitimately the best strings I've ever used. I used to string my guitars with Ernie Balls, but after a couple of weeks I'd have to end up replacing them because they'd become super dull super quickly.

The Cleartones I put on my guitar over a month ago unbelievably still feel like new strings, even after playing them almost every day. Bought it on a whim, and totally won over by them. Going forward these are absolutely my go-to's.",5.0
"Fantastic pedal that does a lot more than just Sabbath. This pedal is on my main gigging board and I use this for almost all of the heavier tunes my band does. It's actually a very versatile pedal and even cleans up nicely, if needed. My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint per se, is it was a little difficult to dial in when playing with a band. It took me a few rehearsals to get it to punch thru in the mix. The key, is running it at 18v. Once I started running at 18v, it instantly cut thru. You get a ton more headroom at 18v, in addition to volume. Highly recommended running at 18v if you play with a full band.",5.0

"This fender was assembled in Japan, a guitar tech (guitar center) told me that the very few guitars they assemble in Japan are on par with USA assembled guitars. I am 52 yrs. old and can remember when everything was msde in Japan, now everything is made in China. I have an Aria Pro 2 acustic (made in Japan 1978) which is now collectable. It rivals any of the new or older martin D series guitars it was modled after.
  Back to the HH. I have a 64 Tele, a 2005 mexican nashville series Tele both of which sound great !! ( the mexican guitars are assembled with USA made parts as well as the HH Jaguar from Japan) But this Special edition Jaguar HH Special is a mean MF!! The sound is unique and transcends any thing else I play. Especially if I want rock my Arse off,very clean as well and smooth effortless playability and action. I've got a Strat w/noiseless Texas special p/us, Meleody Maker w/ p90s, Les Paul studio w/ burstbuckers, Gretsch 5120 and SG w/ 490 r&ts and I love this fender as much as any of the others depending on the sound I want. So if you like to play some hard raw and extremely loud guitar music I suggest you get an HH Special, You won't be sorry. Thanks, Bill (PS don't buy any china made junk, older items made in Japan are collectable these days, not just guitars)",5.0

"Really like this unit.  Know that it is, first and foremost... designed to be connected to an amp.  All sounds are optimized for amps.  I, however... bought it strictly for recording.  The secret is to engage the simulated speaker system so that you can get the modeled sounds of amps with the cabinets.  This makes a big difference!  To achieve this, you just press and hold the TONE BANK button while connecting the power cord.  The only bad thing is you have to do this every time you turn the unit on.  But the sounds are amazing!!

Editing is pretty easy.  But you NEED to read the manual.  Which doesnt come with the unit.  But you can read it on your phone.  There is a learning curve if you are a novice.  But once you get it... its easy.  Hours of fun getting and saving patches await you.  I love the Rectifier amps, and I have a real one!

"In full disclosure, I am not a Samba player, and have not used this in a bateria-style setting. I've generally used this in settings where I needed a deep low booming sound, and I have brought it to drum circles to serve as the ""heartbeat"". Given that this is wood, it has a warmer tone than those found in surdos made from metal, though I'm sure there is a sacrifice in loudness between the two materials (not o say this is a quiet drum by any means). Further warming the tone was the Napa (vinyl, leather-like) head that came with this that makes each strike almost complete bass tone without any ringing as found in typical plastic drum heads. As nice as the richness that the Napa head has, I think it plays much quieter than typical drum heads, and with less definition in pitch among tunings.

The legs extend far enough to bring the height up to tall drummers. They are plenty stable and quite beefy (especially compared to typical floor tom legs) and don't cause any twisting, but still I've found the legs to be the weakest point of the design. Though not a major issue, I find that they don't slide very smoothly, it feels like the knurling is catching all the way, even with the screw completely loosened. I don't have this problem with the aftermarket tom leg brackets from Pearl that I installed on a larger surdo.",5.0
"Perfect for my Sopranino in D-tuning. I recently changed the pegs on my Ukulele and replaced the M600 Martin strings with some ""clear Nylon"" strings I had lying around.

"I Purchased this product with hesitation because the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" is definitely true in this situation.  The day it arrived I unpackaged the speakers first.  Immediately I noticed something wasn't right.  I saw several screws inside the box, and knew I was in trouble.  The grille in front of the speakers was held on by 2 out of 6 screws.  Then, I saw that the sub woofer and the mid range horn were both not attached to the speaker box at all.  I called the number I found on Musysic website and the I told the guy I wanted him to overnight me a new set of speakers.  After some negotiation took place, he offered to refund me only $60 of my money, of which now after a month I still haven't received.  Now keep in mind, I haven't even gotten past the speakers!  I opened the sound board/ amplifier next.  After plugging it in, there was a buzz coming from the amp loud enough that my dog started barking upstairs.  I disassembled the amp, found the cooling fan inside without screws and it was freely moving inside of the amp casing.  After buying a new fan from Radio Shack and tacking the wires back together, the amp was quiet,  until I plugged in the speakers.  Very annoying buzz through the speakers.  No matter what adjustment I made to the board, annoying buzz.  Then I opened the wireless microphones.  It claims to have a range of 120 feet from the receiver?  Nope.  Even with new batteries at most maybe 30-40 feet before the signal fades.  Now on to the speaker stands.  After placing the speakers on them and turning on music, the stands rattled and buzzed to where you could hear it above the music.  I disassembled the stands and removed the debris that remained from the manufacturing process, along with random screws, springs, nuts... What have you.  The system claims to be 2000 watts of power?? No way in the world.  My old Peavy (1980 something model) 200 watt amp and speakers out power this system 10:1.  I will definitely never purchase any other products from Musysic.

"This is the 2nd set of lights I've ordered from this company.  First time was fine; this time, not so much.

I've tried reaching out to this company, but have received no response.  After receiving the 2nd set, I found that only 2 of the 4 light strips are working correctly (displaying the correct color).  The other two strips do not display the correct color when pressed on the remote.

After doing some testing, I've found that 2 of the strips have the ""50RGB"" stamp on it, as well as the RGB labels on each end.  The 2 that are NOT working correctly have nothing stamped on them; just a plain black strip.  I confirmed, and the entire first set I ordered had these stamps also, and are working correctly.

This tells me that somebody put 2 of the wrong strips in this package.  It would be a quick fix if somebody would just reach out to me and swap them with me.

"I have a boss DD3 but I love the sound of a nice analog delay.  I had bought a EH Memory Man some time back but I found it noisy and a bit of a tone sucker.  I bought this pedal because I had recently gotten the BBE Soul Vibe which I love(see review).  So far all the BBEs I've tried have been well made, have ture bypass and, most importantly, sound great.

I had been looking at the Ibanez and a couple of other analog delays but these pedals can be quite expensive.  Amazon's price(as usual) was the cheapest through GTPro.

This pedal gives a very warm, lush delay.  You get two seperate delay times you can switch back and fourth from.  The delay times are short at 330ms, but the sound is beautiful.  It was much quieter and sounded much more natural to my ears than the EH MM that I had.  Perfect for slap back or just nice early delay sounds.  For example a little dirt/fuzz and you can nail the Red House solo tone.  This is a great compliment to a digital delay which can handle longer times and crystal clear sounds better than analog.

My only complaint is that, although you get two delay times you can switch between, you only get on mix and one repeat knob for both channels.  Having separate EQs for each channel would really make this an over the top knockout.  However it's still a great pedal especially at this price.  Since I've gotten it I find that I just get it set and leave it on all the time.  It adds wonderful depth to my tone.",5.0

"Just got my new bag today. Thought it was a light black color, but it's actually gray. They should post the color of the bag in the description. It's a really tight fit on my Crdoba concert Uke. There is no room for anything else inside and it's hard to close the zipper without feeling like you're squashing your Uke. The pocket is only large enough to hold a tuner and some strings. A small music book won't fit. I'm hoping the bag loosens up a bit and becomes easier to close. Having a little buyer's remorse on this one.",2.0

"When it comes to metronomes there's really no better value out there than the Korg MA-30. Just a basic metronome will run you $20, so you'd be wise to spend the same amount of scratch on something that actually has a few useful features, like -

- 1-7 beats per measure.
- More than just a click, it will do triplets, 16th notes, broken triplets and 16ths, 8th notes, etc.
- a dozen pitches, for tuning.
- Very slim, fits easily in your pocket.
- Has a tab on the back that allows you to stand it upright.
- Usable visual indicator for when the metronome is silent.
- EXTREMELY efficient with batteries.
- And my favorite, tap-tempo. This allows you to tap a button and it will figure out the tempo.

I've owned this metronome for a couple years now and what has finally persuaded me to review it here on Amazon is the fact that this thing refuses to die! I swear mine is haunted. I play drums so I like to go from the headphone jack on the metronome into a little guitar amp I had laying around (so I can actually hear the thing while playing the drums). There have been more then a few occasions where I've turned off my amp but failed to turn off the metronome, leaving it running overnight, sometimes all weekend and on one occasion I left it on through a whole 3 day camping trip, only to come back and see it still ticking away... still using the ORIGINAL batteries I bought for it! It only uses a couple AAA batteries! I use this thing daily and I can't believe I haven't had to change the batteries yet, it's incredibly efficient.

One of my favorite features is the tap-tempo. I like to do some recording so when my band mates and I get together it's easy to figure out the tempo of our own music using this metronome, which makes recording in your favorite DAW a lot easier. Also, this is great for finding the tempo of your favorite songs if you like doing covers.

If you're looking for a cheap metronome with some really useful functions then you don't need to look any further. There are a few nit-picks, such as the volume is a little wonky when plugged into something like a guitar amp and there's no backlight, but price/value wise it's hard to beat this, so that's why it deserves 5 stars.",5.0

"I used cathode biased amps for a long time and never had to worry much about biasing but after recently purchasing a '68 Custom DR I found myself back in the adjustable fixed bias world.  A couple of these made the task of biasing that amp quick, easy, and safe.  You could probably get by with just one but having two makes switching between tubes quicker.  Of course, getting a bias meter that accommodates two or four probes would be the ultimate in convenience but I'm not an amp tech biasing amps every day so for me it's not worth the extra scratch.  These work fine for my needs.  Just be sure to read the instructions about how to safely use them with your multi-meter.",5.0

"EDIT - Finally talked with Audiosavings.  The mixer now cycles on and off every half a second and will not stay on.  This is continual even with another power source.  Audiosavings has asked that I return the mixer for their warranty department to review and potentially repair and they will try to have it back to me in 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  I am buying another mixer but sending this back to be ""looked at.""  Looks like I'm buying another mixer and this pile of junk is going to sit in a box somewhere.

AGAIN - Avoid this mixer!
-------------------------------------------------------
Bought this setup to play music for school events.  Planned on plugging a couple of phones/ tablets into the ports to be able to switch back and forth during school events/ dances.

Speakers sound great.  They do not have a low end.  They are mid range but clear and decent quality for the price!  cordless mic setup is actually not too bad either.  Decent little cheap kit.

However, the mixer is junk.  The cords that come with the kit do NOT allow the mixer to plug into the speakers.  You will need to purchase those.  Also, no matter the cords im using, the mixer will only play on one recorded channel.  On songs like Blank spaces half of Taylor's song is missing because its only playing the music track.  I have tried several cords thinking it may have been an issue with stereo cables, etc.... to no avail.

I ended up having to plug directly into the speakers and link them together.  Slow cumbersome process to keep music going.  It was the entire reason I bought a mixer package.... disappointed to say the least.  I should have just bought the speakers and sourced the mixer locally.  I paid too much for just the speakers.

Sent an email to customer support and haven't heard a thing.  If you need speakers AVOID this full package.  The speakers and stand are a great buy for the money but again, source the mixer somewhere else!",2.0

"**Update #2 (January 2018) : I got rid of the Apollo and purchased a PreSonus Quantum 26x32 Thunderbolt 2. Beside the driver issues and terrible customer service, the latency on the Apollo was driving me nuts. Additionally, I couldn't stand the software mixer adding another layer under my DAW. The Presonus not only has eight inputs and fabulous preamps, it has near zero latency.

**Updated ** I've now brought this down to one star because it's been over a month since OSX Sierra was released and UAD has not as of yet released a compatible driver so now all my UAD Apollo Twin and several hundred dollars in purchased plugins are useless. This company simply doesn't care. Hideous customer service.

I wanted to love the Apollo Twin so bad but sadly, after two months of ownership, I'm a fairly disappointed overall. I got this as a replacement for my Mackie 1640i because my new Macbook doesn't have firewire and needed a Thunderbolt interface. Plus, it's portable.  Overall, the Apollo itself is very well built, looks and feels great, sounds great but there are some annoying issues that are dealbreakers for me to continue using this.

To begin with, Universal Audio installs all the demo plugins right alongside your purchased plugins. This is extremely counter-intuitive to workflow and it is extremely annoying to look for a plugin I own, only to have to sift through a list of demo plugins I don't even need/want to see. Even worse, if you hide the demo plugin files on your hard drive by moving them to another folder, after an update, they are all back again. I understand UAD wants to sell plugins but this is a major dealbreaker for me.

The other issue I've run into is the DSP getting overloaded and refusing to load plugins. Sorry, but I can load multiple instances of most Waves plugins and have never had an issue such as this using my computers memory. For this to happen on a dedicated DSP box is poor execution.

As for sound quality, the Apollo just doesn't compare with the Mackie when recording live instruments such as bass, guitars or vocals, especially considering the channel strip is at your fingertips on the Mackie standard console and with the Apollo the console is software based.

Lastly, I was mostly interested in the Ampex or Studer tape plugins but after testing them side-by-side against Waves J37 Tape plugin, the Waves plugin won hands down and is what I ended up purchasing. Plus, the Waves plugins work right off the hard drive and don't require the Apollo unit to be plugged in which is handy if you want to work on some mixes on a laptop while sitting on the couch, etc without wires all over the place.

I wrote this review just to give some of the critical aspects of this device and not to sugar coat it as an all-in-wonder. The Apollo does have some great features and I'll definitely find a place for it in my studio or live rig but I expected more for the price.",1.0

"When I purchased this item I purchased it based on the model reference and the image on the product page, which indicated a product identical or very similar to the OEM version (as I believe most buyers would). Apon recieving the item it was clearly evident that it's not the item that was advertised. The design is completely different, and yet I would not mind that save for a couple major differences.

Although the adapter works well with the keyboard (Thank God), it comes with a very short chord and to the touch is clearly made out of much lower quality materials. The adapter is light as a feather and way too ""plastiky"" feeling. It inspires nothing close to the idea of quality as the OEM version.

This is false advertisement, and although the product has worked so far I will not be buying from this seller again due to the lack of inforamtion on the type of adapter being sold.",2.0

"The Ultrasone headphone appears to be made of a very high quality plastic.  This is pretty common among headphones made in Germany.  My AKG 601 and 701 are made of plastic.  I believe that the Beyerdynamic 990, 880, and 770 also have large amounts of plastic in the construction.  The Sennheiser 600 and 650 also appear to be made of plastic too.  So many of these headphones made by German or Austrian companies seem to be made from plastic or resin.  They may not look as ""expensive"" without more metal parts, but if you look on the inside of most loudspeakers, you will see that they are also constructed of some inert, dense kind of plastic or resin.  It seems to be less likely to cause unwanted vibrations that effect the quality of sound.

The packaging on the new models comes with a hardshell case that allows plenty of room for the headphones and two sets of detachable cords--one is straight and the other is like a pig-tail.  They screw into the headphone.  If you are going to use an adapter to change the plug from 1/4"" to 1/8"" for an Ipod or portable headphone amplifier (always recommended), I suggest the Grado adapter because it has a longer wire that allows the leverage pressure to be off the Ipod jack or headphone jack.  The headphones come with an adaptor, but it is the straight kind that puts a kind of pressure on the jack.  The headphones also come with another set of earpads.

The sound is really great.  The sound is very forward.  You get a good sound stage with a real sense of separation of instruments and/or vocals.  It sounds like the instruments are placed in different locations (which they are of course).  I especially like the sound of live performance recordings.  The bass is sometimes so strong that it can be overpowering.  However, I have heard a pair that has been broken in.  The bass is still very strong, but not overpowering.  The first pair of the Pro 900's were straight out of the box with no breakin.  I am not sure that I would call these headphones ""nuetral.""  If you want nuetral, check out the Sennheiser 600 or 650 or a number of the Audio-Technica (open backed headphones) earphones which present a very balanced sound.  These headphones make a statement--like the so wonderful Grado headphones.

These are really lively and fun, but the bass can be heavy. However, on repeated hearing--especially in jazz, I like the firm, strong bass.  In modern jazz (bebop and later), the time is kept on the bass.  The bass is critical.

I find myself returning to these headphones frequently.  By the way, I also really like the Ultrasone 2500 which has a more balanced presentation, but not quite as exciting as the 900's.  I believe that open ended headphones usually do make for a more open, airy, less bassy sound.

All in all, I have to say that I really enjoy listening to them.",5.0

"It's actually a great little guitar, considering its price.

It ships unbranded, which I wasn't happy with as it's pictures show it with a branding label inside of it and a branded headstock; it is however an unbranded guitar.  That said, let's review.

It's action is pretty good.  Strings do not sit too high or too low, fingers glide up and down the neck taking minimal string pressure, which is very nice.  Its body produces a warm, vibrant sound, however it's volume isn't particularly loud, which is not to say at all that it is a quiet playing guitar, merely that it does not sustain for very long between its string vibration and sound reflection through its medium sized body.

It is a great sized guitar, comfortable playing either standing or sitting.  The paint job is nice, however the paint around the sound hole is nothing more than a sticker decal.  This is fair, however again, when we consider the price of this good little guitar.

The guitar loses tuning on the 6th string frequently. The rest of the strings have a nice and tight winding.  However, this could be because of the generic non branded guitar strings it ships with.  At this time, I am still playing with its original strings, so therefore I will not rule out its string tuners.

I have been playing for half of my life, this was a great way to get me back into playing as the costs of guitars is too high.  I suggest this as a great way to get back into playing, or get started playing because of its price and its acceptable quality.  With an external microphone, it records nicely.  It is a great option for jamming between friends and family, and I couldn't see why it wouldn't be great for beginners learning the art.

All in all, I like it a lot.  I do wish it had its labeling as depicted, but as someone who has bought plenty from China on Amazon and eBay, I know how it goes.  Highly recommended for its cost and acceptable quality.",4.0
"I love this guitar! I honestly never held a Squire brand strat before, but compared to everything I've held, played, and heard in the past; this guitar really gives you the best bang for your buck.

The Melody Harp is a lot of fun to play. I enjoyed it immediately. However I did not realize how sensitive the tuning was and broke a string right away. The good thing is that they give you one replacement string with the kit and they supply you with a lifetime of strings. The biggest problem is it goes out of tune fast. But if you have patience it is easy to tune. I like it a lot and would recommend it before you buy any other stringed instrument like a dulcimer.,4.0

The device works well. But be careful if your device that needs charging is not of US origin. This adaptor's connector tips have holes inside them; positive and negative poles are placed such that one of them is outside of the connector tip and the other one is inside of the hole in the tip. So if your device that is to be charged originally has connectors without holes which means both poles are outside of the tip you can't use this adaptor's connector tips. As a workaround I cut my original connector's wires and plugged the bare wires to the socket which actually needs the connector tips to be plugged in.,4.0

"Pros...very articulate eq, very noticeable sweep in all the controls. Seems loud for such a small amp, loud enough for small venues with small bands, like acoustic groups and non-drummer outfits. Its small and easy to pack up and move. It came with a cool amp cover.
Cons...seems loud enough, however i had to turn the amp up completely, does not go to eleven. The power jack needed to be recessed as well as the control panel. Im a bit bothered that everything on this amp is surfaced mounted. Dinky power switch, will it survive a hit?
Overall this amp has alot of quality and great sound. If this amp were a 5 star it would have cost more$$$. Was made in china and made affordable so its what we want right?

Im perplexed as to why this amp is no longer on phil jones web site? Im still afraid this amp will get damaged because the power cord and panels are surface mounted.

If you have the SB2 and want to use Rekordbox, you can however if your have the RB and want to use Serato, you cannot without remapping.  With that in mind, you can try out both software's without buying new controllers that work with them because the SB2 works with both.  Fantastic controller.",5.0
I bought these a couple months ago. I used them for 2 gigs. First gig was OK as it was just me talking. 2nd gig was no good. One of the mics is dead and the range is only 15 to 20 feet. At about 10 feet they drop off and get static. I keep them in the box and take care of them. I used the 10 dollar durecell batteries and buy them before each gig. This was embarassing. I had a cerimony where the transmitter was no more than 15 feet from the reciver and the pastor doing the wedding was droppin out BAD! Only about 1/2 the cerimony worked. When the mic was used for the Vows the bride had zero reception and everything she said was NOT heard! Its deadly when you have a paid gig and things do not work! So i am going back to the good ol long mic cords. More stable. I may even invest in a real mic such as sure or EV. You get what you paid for. Its not worth sending back as im sure shipping will be as much as the unit costs!,1.0
"Yes, like other people say it is big :)  If you think you will eventually need a two trumpet case, it might be worth it to get one--this is about the same outer size but only has place for one trumpet.

It's a pretty decent guitar. This was my first guitar purchase. I was looking at the cheaper beginner sets but didn't really want a cheap guitar. I also didn't want a very expensive one either. This one was in my budget. It feels nice and has a nice weight to it. I have picked up a few guitars from the beginner bundles and they feel pretty light weight and cheap. This one does not feel that way. Would recommend this one to other people looking to start on guitars. Mine arrived in good condition.. All the strings were in great shape as were the tuners.,5.0
"Bought this 4 days ago had to fiddle with the settings  to get it to work. No clear directions in manual. This is something that has to be done with all interfaces.

In some of them it could be that not all the settings are set right. I had to download win 10 drivers and change all the settings on 2 win 10 computers (laptop and desktop) everything I have tried is working. I will be able to do 4 channels drums which is the main reason I bought this. I will be able to record 4 channels how ever I want. The features/price can't be beat.

"I was looking for a cheap alternative to a Carbon Copy and this is it. One thing I'll say is that the self-oscillation isn't as smooth as I'd like, it gets too distorted sounding.
For a cheaper pedal, the housing is decent quality (better than Behringer's plastic), although I don't believe it's metal, but I'm not sure. I've marked settings I prefer with a sharpie around the knobs, so that helps if I want to find something quick, depending on the kind of music I'm playing.

"I had to have it. Sounds great acoustically. Very comfortable, small profile.looks cool. Made well.
Plugged in at home it sounds so real. No piezo compressed sound at all, great dynamics...real acoustic sounding. But.. at a gig plugged in you have to contend with so much woof feedback. It's very frustrating . They need to make a better eq system. Some kind of sweeping eq to get out these bad feedback spots.
  I put in a sound hole feedback buster which helps some.
You must have an external eq or preamp of some sort to get this  somewhat usable for a live gig.. there is a ground lift switch inside that also will help, but still..
..I'm keeping it because it is truly a lovely instrument, but they need to fix up the EQ options..
It's kind of cocky they only give the user two knobs to adjust ts thing..

"It's definitely a low hanging strap, but if you look at it.  Its not very conservative and thus the style is for those who wear there instrument low.  Great for me with Bass as I tend to wear bass low, probably wound not be ideal for me on my guitar since I tend to wear it a bit higher.

"I have been using the Shure PG14 / PG185 sysytem for 2 weeks now at my Unitarian Universalist church.  It was realativly inexpensive, but not what I would call ""cheap"".  The included condensor microphone is of good quailty.  There are no drop outs or static even when the transmiter unit is a good 95 feet from the reciver.  The antenna's for the reciver are inside the box, so you can't bend or break them. I did not expect a ""dual diversity"" reciver and audio companding for around 300 dollars.  My only probem was the output from the reciver was not enough to drive my high level input on the Mackie mixer to anything more than a whisper.  I sacrificed one of my microphone channels ( The system also has ""mic level"" output), wich has way more gain, and the system works pretty good now. It's worth the price.

"I bought several Chakra singing bowls on Amazon at the same time and the rest of them all came with a nice dowel and pad- essential elements, as it were. This one, I assumed would be the same. It was not. The box is smaller because it doesn't have the niceties in the bottom, but those aren't needed and not why I rated it 3 stars (satin type bedding to rest the bowl). This bowl came with a dowel and a useless and cheap ""Chakra"" bracelet. Literally just some plastic beads in chakra colors. I tried to use it and was unable to get it to sing like I had with the others. Wondering if perhaps the pad made the difference, I put one from another bowl under it and VOILA! It sang. So, as far as I'm concerned, be forewarned that you should do your homework and make sure it comes with the pad. The bowl and dowel itself are in fine condition (the dowel might be a little ragged, but it works just fine).",3.0

"Don't waste your money on this one! I record convention speakers to render to CDs. Thought I'd try the poor man's wireless setup and avoid going thru a mixer/preamp. Boy was I wrong with this one! Used mine 1 time and about 30 minutes into the recording started getting static interference. Small but VERY noticeable static scratches for <= 1 second every 2 minutes+/- for the remainder of a 70 minute talk. At first it was almost undetectable while monitoring but after burning the CD it became very obvious. Enough so that I could not use the master I recorded from the ULM100USB. Luckily I had a digital recorder tied to the mic stand as a backup!

I sent 2 sample clips of the noise to Behringer Customer Care along with a detailed account of how it was being used. Their answer, ""I've listened to both audio files and heard the static you mentioned previously.  This sounds kind of like general interference coming through."" General interference??? So I should expect and accept ""General Interference"" from their product?

The static has increased to every hard consonant gets a scratch. And Behringer Customer Care has stopped responding to my email requests for a warrantee return!  I guess with this product you really don't get the clarity they advertise but you do get ""General interference"".

"Without a doubt, z3ta+ is the best software synth around. For those looking for a sweet analog sound but do not have the money to buy a Waldorf or an Andromeda, z3ta+ is your best choice by far. The amount of parameters on the device is staggering to say the least. You can practically control everything with its own LFO or envelope (You can control LFOs with more LFOs). There is an ungodly amount of oscillators as well, making this the most sonically capable synthesizer available for under $2k. And the best thing, z3ta+ sounds amazing! The only thing that detracts from it is its rather steep learning curve. If you are a sound crafter,  expect a couple of days of toying before you are comfortable with it. For me, it was just as hard to grasp as FM synths. (Which some found easy actually)",5.0

"Incredible!! If you use Ableton and do not have Push, what are you doing? Push will accelerate your production and performance, I promise. I have spent the past two years learning Ableton so I know the software pretty well. I use Push more for production, and it integrated seamlessly into my workflow. Sometimes I will find myself just jamming out on this thing. I love the visual feedback you get on the Push, you know exactly what parameter you are changing without looking at your computer. I would recommend having a decent understanding of Ableton before purchasing Push. That way you can devote your time to learning the ins and outs of the hardware and how it works with your software. The pads are great. They are more touch sensitive rather than buttons. The knobs and buttons are great. You can just feel how sturdy and well manufactured the Push is when you hold it. It has some weight to it.

Speeds up production
Sturdy Hardware
Integrates seamlessly with Ableton

"I am learning violin/fiddle, so I'm always looking for different products to make my practice a bit easier on me.  I ordered this because I'd never heard of this brand before, and it looked like it would match the brown chinrest and tailpiece on my primary violin.

It showed up quickly and I starting using it right away.  I have to say that when I firs opened the box, I was very disappointed  the little feet that you adjust and use to attach to your violin just screw directly into the shoulder rest itself.  I thought that was a really cheap design, but I went ahead and tried it anyway.  It turned out that is really works quite well.  There is no wobbliness  just the two feet and the shoulder rest itself.  I don't know how they pulled that off but  well done!

My violin teacher was also impressed with the way this is designed.

The downside is that this offers no padding at all.  I've been using a large rubber band with a large contoured sponge-like shoulder rest, so I really noticed the hardness.  However, I've also got other shoulder rests with the feet that have a rubbery/foam type of coating, and those aren't any more comfortable for me.

"Like everyone else stated here excellent sound quality and simple to use bluetooth headphones, but terrible build quality. The layout of the buttons are simple, may take getting used to for turning on the sd music while wearing otherwise take them off to turn that on.

The problem with the hardware quality are the hinges and the plastic piece above it. The plastic will eventually break, possibly in away allowing the pin holding the hinge to fall out. If you do buy these headphones take early action and use a plastic safe adhesive to hold it all together. Buy a plastic safe epoxy glue and clean the pieces you will glue with rubbing alcohol (allow to dry a few minutes before gluing). As stated in the title do not glue the hinge, only the seams above the hinge leading up to the metal piece. Also allow the glue to dry an hour longer than its indicated time, unless you like the idea of permanent headphones.

It's an extreme measure, but necessary as it is not a matter of if but a matter of when they will break. I had my headphones for three months and noticed a chip that exposed the left sides hinge pin. No way to replace that plastic, but I fixed it enough and have had it almost a year and will probably have it for a year or two. Which will be worth the money spent.

It has always sounded great, but about 5 years of playing it really started to sound amazing as the wood really broke in (pretty usual for guitars I think).  It has a very warm, bassy tone, more akin to Martin than Taylor.  Maybe not what people are looking for in recording, but a very pleasant sound for everything else.  The preamp/pickup that came in mine was mediocre, but I did not expect much.  I'm not sure if the newer models are better.  I can honestly say I love my guitar and I have no reason to upgrade, save a better sound when plugging in if I ever wanted that.",5.0

"The nut did not fit my Fender Squier Strat (the nut was too narrow).  The description should have been more specific about which guitars it would fit.  Also, it said it was bone but it seemed very much like ordinary plastic.  The grooves didn't seem like great fits for the strings, but this wasn't so important since you would probably want to file it down anyway.",1.0
"I've been trying a variety of LED bulbs because I like the power savings and the lack of mercury.  Depending on what I find, I'll put them in place suitable for its performance.  Some first-generation LED bulbs I've replaced and thrown away in favor of newer versions.

What I like about the HitLights AffordXII 12W Cool White LED Bulb:
1. Bulb is nice and bright, plenty of lumens for most applications.
2. Compact; can fit in most places bulbs are used.
3. Only somewhat directional, not as directional as many LED bulbs.

What I don't like:
1. The color is more bluish than other LED bulbs I have tried.

I experimented with this bulb in a number of places, trying to find somewhere the color would be acceptable.  I gave up on even putting it in my basement because the color is objectionable.  Finally, I put it in the garage.  When my wife saw it there she said, ""This will take some getting used to.""  At least it works there.",3.0

"A good set of bluetooth speakers is on a lot of people's wish list these days. This set of speakers has a lot of strengths at an impressive price point.

INSTALLATION/SETUP
-Dead easy. Plug in the right speaker. Wire the speakers together. Turn it on. Push the bluetooth button and pair with your phone. Play music.

DESIGN
-Simple, attractive, textured-black finish. The speaker drivers are nicely protected by metal mesh grilles.

ERGONOMICS
-I like the volume control knob on the front. I wish the power switch was on the front also.
-There are no other controls except for a Bluetooth pairing button.

SOUND QUALITY
Overall a good quality sound which should satisfy the vast majority of listeners. The strength of these speakers is the impressive bass for speakers small enough to fit on a shelf.  These little guys will pound the walls. The downside is that the bass tends to overwhelm the mid and high frequencies thus compromising the vocal clarity. Don't expect vocals to be really crisp and clean.

An adjustment knob for the bass would have been helpful to balance the sound to your personal preference.

SOUND VOLUME
These speakers play extremely and impressively LOUD. With the volume knob barely turned past minimum (and phone set to max), they will fill a typical bedroom or office. With the volume turned up, they get to ear-piercing levels and can fill a large outdoor space or a small house without any significant distortion or crackling.

CONCLUSION
Get these speakers if you want easy setup of streaming music and enjoy heavy bass and high volume in a package small enough to fit on a shelf. While the sound quality will be fine for most people, don't get these if you are expecting ""audiophile"" quality in the mid-high frequencies. Overall, a solid set of speakers if you understand the limitations. They are a good value at the current $150 price point.",4.0

Top of stand does not sit level at all. Back support was installed crooked. Went to adjust the tilt and noticed the wood was cracked. Stand looks like it was just thrown together quickly with no mind to quality. I had no choice but to glue it and re level it with screws because I needed to use it 3 days after it arrived.

"Installed on a 2001 Squier Affinity P-Bass.  When received the input jack tip terminal was bent flat.  I attempted to carefully bend it back in place, but it snapped.  I had to desolder the one that came with the pickguard and install a new jack.  The screw holes do not line up, I had to drill new ones.  The pickup cutout is too tight and will probably need some light sanding as the pick up covers stick to the side when trying to adjust them.  Neck cut out is too small, I had to sand it to make it fit.

The electronics seem to be equivalent quality to what originally came on the Squier Affinty bass.

I didn't expect much for this price but it still fell short of my expectations.  I would never install this one a bass I actually care about.",2.0

"This is a great little keyboard and my son (2 years) loves it.  Yes the keys are small, but you know that going into it.  I usually play a full size keyboard but after a couple minutes playing this thing I adjust like its nothing.  It has lots of options for sounds and a few onboard songs.  I like to use it when I am sitting on my recliner watching TV and trying to find the notes to the songs in my head.  Works great for that.  I really bought it for my son though.  He is very musical and loves his musical toys the most, almost to the exclusion of most of his other toys.  This is the perfect size for him and although he is is only 2 I think it is important for him to have access to musical instruments at all times.  He already know more of the keyboards functions than I do.  It is a great quality product, just know that the keys are small but it sounds good.",5.0

"Got this as my first ukulele. I play guitar and banjo already and after doing lots of research, I figured the tenor size would work best since I have short and fat fingers. This ukulele is turning out to be a perfect fit not only for my playing but also for getting me hooked on ukulele. I want to get another one to keep tuned with a low G. This instrument is quality made enough to be a solid beginner ukulele. It doesn't feel too cheap. It sounds decent. It arrived in just under a month from China. It doesn't come with anything, so get yourself a case and a tuner if needed. The zebra wood look is an acquired taste - maybe the only flaw and is basically the only reason I'd get a different kind of ukulele to have for my low G instrument. The sun design around the sound hole gives it subtle character. The design is carved into the wood, so it isn't terrible quality. Tuners, strings, and bridge are solid. Some reviewers mention the sharp fret wires. True. All the fret wires could be filed down on both edges of the neck. I haven't done that yet as it isn't that much of a nuisance, but if one is going to prefect the instrument, that's one thing they could do. That all said, I highly recommend this for a starter instrument.",5.0

"Speaker soakers and attenuators are tricky pieces of gear upfront. If your resistances aren't adjusted properly, or crank your power beyond what the attenuator is rated for, you could have problems. The purpose of an attenuator isn't to run your amp at 100% so you're dumping all of it's power into the attenuator. Rather, the goal (as always) is to get an awesome sound. Unless you're recording, getting hot tube overdrive really isn't necessary. Every amp has a ""sweet spot"" in terms of its volume and gain settings, for my Marshall JCM2000 DSL50, I like running my volume between 5~7, and adjusting my channel's gain accordingly. It sounds great, but it's just too loud for the neighbors... so enter the Speaker Soak.

If the only reason you're looking to buy an attenuator is because you need to keep the volume low while you're rocking out in the garage or bedroom... then I would seriously consider buying a practice amp instead. Carl's Speaker Soak is really meant for those 15-30 watt lunchbox tube amps that need to get cranked to 11 before they sound amazing. Other options you might consider would be the Behringer Vintage Tube Monster if you want high-octane tube tone at low volumes. The Behringer VT999 can give you all the tube tone you want, and after running it into a clean solid state channel, will allow you to find just the volume setting you need.

I bought my Speaker Soak because I wanted to run my JCM2000 directly into my ADA GCS-3 Speaker Simulator (for direct input recording), but I needed an attenuator in my signal chain to soak up some volume before it goes to my speaker (so I won't disturb my roommates).

If you are looking to buy an attenuator because you're running with a 100-watt Marshall full-stack... I'd look elsewhere.

Another (1-star) reviewer had some problems with his attenuator smoking. Well, he may have spoken too soon. My attenuator also smoked, but this was in fact component glue inside that was burning - not the attenuator itself. This was also after I had set my amp's volume to max and the Speaker Soak to Min (0)... which isn't how I'd use the Speaker Soak in reality.

If you want an attenuator to shave 25-75% of your volume, but maintain 95-100% of your tone, then this product is for you.",4.0

"The M-Audio SuperDAC is a solid, attractive DAC with a good feature set.  I really liked the way it sounded from the moment I first switched it on. But there's a lot of competition at this price level, with companies trying to distinguish themselves not just on sound quality and features but on design and how the user experiences the device.

DAC CHIP:  The SuperDAC uses one Wolfson WM8740 SEDS chip.  This DAC/ADC chip has been around for some time, and is well regarded.

DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY:  The Super DAC seems fairly well-built and attractively designed.  The switches and connectors seem solid.  It looks better in person than in the pictures, for some reason.  The Super DAC is 3-1/2 inches wide, 4 inches deep (including the switches on the front and the connectors on the back, but not including room for the connected cables); and just over 1-5/8"" high including the volume control.  The volume control has about 40 steps; it's functional but not especially nice to use.

PACKAGE CONTENTS:  Besides the Super DAC, the package includes a USB-to-Mini-USB cable; an RCA cable; and the user guide. The cables are somewhat basic but will get you connected.

POWER SUPPLY NOT INCLUDED:  I can understand somewhat why M-Audio didn't include a power supply.  It would have added to the production cost, and there's a real question as to whether most people would actually use a power supply.  Computer users can draw power from a USB port.  High-end audiophiles would no doubt be skeptical and upgrade the power supply.  However, on balance and at this price it would have been nice to have a power supply included.  M-Audio can source a power supply much more easily than we can.  A power supply would allow the DAC to be used when a powered USB port is not available (such as with a TV, amplifier or receiver), or when the power from the USB port is insufficient or uneven.  The specification for a USB 2.0 port is 0.5 amp, so that provides just 2 watts of power.  Try to use a USB 3.0 port or other higher powered port if you can.  As far as the specs for a power supply, the SuperDAC uses a 12V DC, center positive pin, likely 2.1mm x 5.5mm.  M-Audio recommends 1 amp.

DOWNLOAD DRIVERS: For electronics, I never use any included drivers or software, they're rarely up to date. I always go download the current versions. So I'm glad M-Audio didn't include a CD in the package, that would end up in a landfill.  (Even though there's only a 1.0 version of the driver.)  It appears the driver is the C-Media USB Audio Class Driver 7.0.12.713 dated 7/13/12, so if you're using another USB audio device that may already be installed on your system.

SET UP YOUR SOFTWARE:  You're not done yet.  You need to make sure your system software and your player are providing output at the bit and sample rates you want, if you're using more than 16 bit / 44.1khz.  At a minimum, check the properties of the USB device; in Windows, go to the the Supported Formats tab, Sample Rates and enable those you want to use.  (The little Test feature in this tab is a way to run through all the sample rates on the SuperDAC.)

ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSION?  The M-Audio site implies you can do analog to digital conversion (ADC), as well as digital to analog conversion (DAC).  (It states the SuperDAC has ""audiophile-grade Wolfson DAC/ADCs."") But ADC isn't documented in the User Guide, and I haven't tried that.  It's unclear whether there is a default sampling rate and bit depth for any of the outputs, or whether that can be selected.

OPENING THE CASE: If you, like me, feel compelled to open this up, under the four pads at the bottom (of course) are four Phillips head screws to remove the metal base and EM shield.  Four more Phillips head screws hold the PCB.  The volume control slides off.  Slide the front plate and PCB out carefully, there's one wire set connecting it to the chassis.

By the way, M-Audio has a history of making well-regarded audio interfaces.  They previously made a well regarded product also called the Super DAC, and most of the current references online are to the older version.  This is a completely redesigned and very different version released around September, 2015.

It is a very sturdy case, built to keep the pan safe under typical road conditions. Having spent a good deal of time loading, transporting and unloading all kinds of musical equipment, this is important to me.

I can honestly say that playing this pan was a joyful experience for me.  I own another Tzevaot pan that I am very happy with as well.  They do make a quality instrument.",5.0

"I've had this Ukulele for about 2 weeks now and it's a beautiful, great sounding little Uke! Yes it's laminated and even the wood surface feels like plastic but it's not. Yes I still have to tune it every time I play it, though the amount that it goes out of tune is getting less and less as the strings stabilize and stretch to their intended length. I use a Snark SN-2 to keep it in tune and I suggest everyone buy a tuner at the same time as you buy your Ukulele. I didn't and was trying to use my piano to tune it, then using the CD that came with the book I bought to tune it, but having a Snark is MUCH easier and convenient, and they are only $10 so why not just get one right away?
My only regret in retrospect is that I wish I had bought a tenor Ukulele instead of a soprano. The fretboard is a bit longer so the frets are a bit bigger and therefore easier to play some of the chords where your fingers are all bunched together. Yes, tenors cost more, but I found a good Tenor Ukulele on this site for $70 that I may upgrade to in the future if I find myself sticking with the Uke.

"This is a good product for the money.  I read many of the reviews(if you don't find enough here, just check in other colors, especially black).  I just made a few instrument cables and I'm pleased with the results.  The weakest point in this cable is the shield.  It's better that what I expected.  Just don't expect a braided design.  The lead wires are good quality as well as the insulation.  They use multiple strings for tensile strength which is more difficult to prep for soldering.  I'm keeping mine and will buy it again for certain applications.",5.0
The only reason that I gave it two stars is the marker... And thats only for large logos.  If you don't stay inside the stencil it bleeds right thru the sticker that they give you for the logo.

Also like a previous statement the series markings are to small for the included marker.  Sabian... Stick to making cymbals.,2.0
"Looks like a decent enough cone, but it doesn't look like the one in the photo. The spiral stiffening ribs or ridges are obviously different.

The rib pattern in the Amazon photo looks like the one developed by National in the late 1920s, after making something between 200 and 300 Tricones. (Of course the Tricones then used - and still use today - smaller diameter cones. This cone is the larger single type used in the Style ""O"", Triolian and Duolian guitars.) And the short radial ridges near the outer diameter were added by National sometime in the mid-1930s. In other words ... a fully-developed National-style cone should look like the Amazon photo.

The supplied cone has no radial ribs, and much shorter spiral ribs. I don't know where that pattern originated, but it doesn't look much like any original National I know, although the cone's overall dimensions are pretty much like National's.",3.0

"I know there are purists out there who want old school solid steel pedals.  I have a friend who refuses to buy a Behringer pedal purely based on the fact that it is plastic.  I bought this pedal and had a surprise blind test with him.  He had no idea who manufactured the pedal which made the results oh so satisfying.

The second I turned it on he immediately was interested.  I played with the settings and ran some scales for a few minutes before asking him what he thought it was and how much it may have cost.  His guess was a Boss pedal in the 100 dollar range; this guess was champion of my cause, as he used to own the Boss OC-3.  After he guessed I couldn't hold it in anymore, I told him to open his eyes and bask in the glory that is the Behringer U0300 Ultra Octaver.  He laughed because he knew what just occurred, inadvertent admittance that plastic pedals are just as good as metal ones.

Now I will review the pedal for serious.  The pedal has a 3 mode range selector, low, mid, and high.  These settings adjust the frequency for use with different instruments.  Yes, you can use this pedal with a keyboard, bass guitar, traditional guitar, electric-acoustic, whatever you want!  You use the range to adjust to the instruments frequencies, so for example on Bass guitar you would want to use the low range output.

Next is the Direct control.  This control adjusts the original input signals level.  So basically it is a volume knob for your guitars input.

The Octave 1 control adjusts the level of the signal ONE octave below your original signal.  It is pretty self explanatory, but basically if you play an open A note, the pedal will generate another A note, one octave below.  This control is another volume control but for the generated octave.

The Octave 2 control works the same exact way as Octave 1, except this control adjusts the level of the generated note that is TWO octaves below the original.

This pedal has an LED that is not as bright as the other Behringer pedals.  The battery is located underneath the foot switch which you can pretty easily get to using a ball point pen on the two spring latches.  Note that this pedal has no on / off switch so you will need to remove your input jack while not in use to prolong the batteries life.

All in all I give this pedal 5 stars because it's price is incomparable, the sound is exactly what I wanted, and the controls feel good and solid.",5.0

"Know what you're getting. This is a very nice basic aluminum darbuka for the price. It has a higher pitch and a smaller area to hit the Doum sound, but not out of line with other Darbukas.

Good for kids and getting to know the instrument, then deciding if you'd like to pay 10-20 times the price for a bigger, more professional-sounding instrument.

Regarding comments by the other reviewer, I've had no issues tuning. I'm one of the palest people on the planet. No issues with hands turning black - not sure what that's referring to. At the price, I see this is a much better option than the smaller Meinl Darbukas.",4.0

"I used this speaker for two different purposes: (1) for my sax monitor in a stage band; (2) as a portable PA for live speaking engagements. For both purposes, it more than did the job. First, as a sax monitor, it enabled me to have far more control right in front of me (the sound men have a bad knack of burying the sax in the mix, while I like to be just behind the vocal). I was able to control my EQ as well as volume live on the fly for adjustments in shows. The sound is so good the band often thought I was in the MAIN MIX when they were just hearing my monitor - not kidding. The sound quality is SUPERIOR to the Behringer (yes, I did a sound comparison). Get the bag or create a carrying case for it - you'll need it. As a personal PA, or with both vocal and sax in small engagements, it was ALL I needed. It's light, and easy to haul. The reason for 1 star off - it FRIES easily! I dropped it once and blew the board. Another time I plugged my effects pedal into it and fried the board.

"So much smaller than expected. Really couldn't light up a wall. Purchased for putting into stage lighting for a middle school musical, but had to return it because the ripple effect stopped working the second time we plugged it in. We might have kept it to put it in somewhere in scenes that didn't require a larger effect, but really didn't see any value to returning and replacing it with a new one since it failed so quickly and easily. If you know what you're getting and you get lucky enough to get a functional one, the ripple effect is pretty cool.

OK, so I did hear from the manufacture and they did make things right with the product. We did get a replacement and the replacement worked as expected. For such a small light, it really does light up a wall. We can't really test it out in production until our next event comes around, but just testing it makes me believe this will do very nicely.

The keyboard actually looked really old like it was there for years but I just cleaned it up and it looks more decent now. When I first played it the left speaker kept making a crackling sound that was really annoying, but I thought maybe since its new it would make that sound at first. I have been playing every day and it is still continuously making that sound. The packaging on the inside had also upset me because the headphones were placed under the keyboard and that makes no sense because they could easily be crushed and they aren't exactly the best material. The headphones are actually broken, I realized that when I went to adjust them and one side slipped out. Also at the top there seems to be a crack inside the foamy material. They don't play very loud either but its good enough for now until they eventually stop working. The stand is very strong, I was surprised at first because it looks so flimsy.

I bought this so I could connect my Casio PX-350 keyboard to Synthesia running on my iPad Pro, and it works flawlessly. I love the wireless connection-- now I don't have to fiddle around with a bunch of cords and adapters running around my piano. I can just set my iPad on the music stand and start playing, and take it with me when I'm done.

I was a little worried when I bought this because I read the reviews on here and some people were having problems updating the firmware, but I updated the firmware straight out of the box and have had no issues at all. The update process isn't completely intuitive, but if you're having trouble, try this:

1. Plug in the mi. 1, but don't turn on the device
2. Download the Piano Jukebox app by QUICCO SOUND Corporation on the App Store (don't download the ""mi. 1 connect"" app-- apparently that's for iOS 7 only; Piano Jukebox is for iOS 8+)
3. Open Piano Jukebox app
3. Tap the gear in the lower-right corner and select ""Firmware Update""
4. Turn on the device so the iOS device can find the mi. 1. The mi. 1 will start updating its firmware when found
5. When firmware is successfully updated, tap the lower-left mi. 1 logo in the app and tap the mi. 1 Input/Output to enable the connection
6. Exit the app, boot up your preferred app and connect the mi. 1 in its connection settings. In Synthesia, you can find this under Settings > Music Devices > Music Input",5.0

"For its price, I was worried about the durability of the Ashton BNJ50 banjo. I've priced them in local stores and $300 is the lowest I've found, and that one was used. When the box came, I eagerly opened the box to start checking this banjo out. First, there was a cap nut that fell off during shipping. That's not a big deal, however, as no damage occurred and it didn't take long to screw the cap nut back on. The banjo was also horribly out of tune, but again, that was an easy fix.

I do debate the shipping weight under product information. There is no way this banjo is a couple ounces or a pound. I'd say it's more like 5 to 10 pounds.

With all cap nuts checked and the banjo now in tune, I really picked it up and am kind of surprised at just how heavy the banjo is in compared to how heavy it looks. This is a really solid banjo. I don't play much, but I'm planning to have my son teach me. My son, however, does play and immediately took one of my favorite Of Monsters and Men songs (Little Talks) and played it on the banjo. In terms of sound quality, this banjo is amazing. And, I have to admit that Little Talks does blend itself very well to a banjo song.

If you want an affordable banjo for your collection or to learn, this Ashton model is definitely impressive and one I highly recommend.",4.0

"I bought these earphones by Able Planet after reading various online reviews.  While these are an older model, and thus reduced in price, I found that the fidelity was pretty good, and the sound isolation was a whole lot better than an earphone that is not designed to isolate the sound. Since you can customize the ear-buds (three sizes of soft covers)I was able to make them feel good in my ears for long periods at a stretch.

The only reason that I  have not given these a five- star review is that some of the other features offered (in line mike, in -line controls for Apple's I -series of  music players and phones etc.) do not work for other devices, though  that may not be the situation on newer models.

All in all I think the company makes good earphones (don't know about their headphones) at good price points and I will continue to buy their products.",4.0

"Just received mine.  Much higher quality than I'd expect from a $500 guitar.  The cherry sunburst color is just great - not too bright but it does look stricking.  These pickups do give you the ""Les Paul"" sound -- thick, heavy, dark -- whatever you want to call it.  I'm having fun exploring all the sounds you get from the new pop-up knobs that let you adjust either the humbucker or single coil.  Also, the action was fine for me right out of the box.  So far I've not experienced tuning issues that I read about in some of the other reviews of the older Epiphone Les Pauls.

I'm an acoustic player (Martin DCPA4) and wanted to buy the Gibson Les Paul Studio but they don't make a left handed version.  I didn't want to spend $1,600 for the Gibson Les Paul Standard so I shifted to the Epiphone because I still wanted the Les Paul sound.  Wow!

"I should preface this by saying I've been a professional musician for approx. 15 years and have used many multi-FX units over that time, well as individual pedals. I've had Boss GT6, 8 and 10, various rack effects (Marshall, Rocktron and others), and of course, I own many pedals.

I purchased the Nova system as I needed a portable rig that could multi-task, was easy to setup and breakdown and could provide me with the essential sounds one needs to play shows. It's priced reasonably and doesn't use a wall-wart.

The case is made of metal, and doesn't take up too much space on a pedal board.

I'm not using this in preset mode, but rather, manual mode. Meaning, each foot-switch turns on and off an individual effect.

Some of the PRO's -

Solid input / output jacks. Foot-switches are sturdy and solid. Smaller footprint compared to some multi-FX units.
Drive sounds are VERY good, much better than what you normally find in these units although having said that, you've only got 2 variants to choose from.

On board tap-tempo and boost are also great and work extremely well. The menu layout is minimal, but it quickly makes sense if you've used these units before. On the fly editing is pretty straight forward: just click the button of the type of effect you want to edit, then use the jog wheels to edit. The led's are also very bright and it's easy to see what's on, and what isn't.

Some have flamed the tuner function, I happen to think it's pretty good. Not really sure what the fuss is here!

Standout FX, for me, are Reverb, Pitch and Compression. Good FX are the Boost and Drive circuits while ""OK"" would be the Mod and the Delays.

Some of the CON's

Firstly the buttons that live on the face of the unit. They feel cheap and inferior, like something off a Fisher and Price toy. I've read on forums that these can ""stick"" and I'm really not surprised. Compared to the Boss GT series which have an audible ""click,"" these just don't match up at all. These buttons do worry me to be honest, and I have concerns about their longevity. They feel like they have been salvaged from a $200 Behringer mixing desk.

The rotary editing buttons also feel a bit ""Behringer"" to me. They work, sure but there's that cheap and nasty feel to them.

Some of the effects, for me, aren't as analog and as chewy as I'd like and there are minimal parameters to edit. For instance, the Boss GT series delays kick this things out of the park and there are way more editing capabilities. The delays on the Nova are ""there"" but it's just ""meh"" for me. I was very unimpressed, and uninspired, especially given the pedigree of the TC name. You really do expect more, given the hype around this company.

Same goes for the mod FX. If you like your cheesy 80's chorus, then you'll no doubt be happy with the unit, but if you're looking for more chewy analog stuff, then this will likely disappoint. Again, the Boss GT series has a lot more editing parameters over the TC which quite honestly, surprised me.

As I mentioned, many of the parameters are limited. I expected a deeper editing experience with this, given the TC name.

Another con is the lack of other ""essential"" FX such as a Rotary, a T-Wah and the like. For the price, many other competitors have a lot more offerings. TC need to do likewise. Also, many other units offer a loop where you can insert a fave OD, or Fuzz unit. The Nova DOES NOT which again, is a let down.

Also, the Noise Suppressor is a bit of a joke. Again, TC went ""el cheapo"" on the editing parameters here.

I haven't tried the speaker sim function, or the MIDI functionality.

Would I purchase this unit again? Very hard to say. A great concept let down by some shortfalls in editing, some mediocre sounding FX and the cheap/nasty feel of the editing buttons that seem to have been salvaged from a $200 Behringer mixing desk.

This *could* be an amazing unit, if TC paid some attention to it and there really aren't many units like this in the market place that just do FX without all of the silly amp modelling crap. A lot of players don't want amp modelling, they just want quality FX in a neat and compact package. This delivers that, to a point but there ARE compromises.",3.0
"I purchased this for our three kids for Christmas, and it looks like a great machine so I hope it does not disappoint.  I will update after Christmas when they begin using it.

"I'm a bit baffled by some of the reviews here.  I got EZDrummer recently and I'm very happy with it so far.  Let me clear up a few things:

1) It's a virtual instrument (says so right on the name).  Apparently some people don't understand what that means.  What that means is that you plug it into your favorite ""main"" sequencer program (FL Studio, Cubase, Mixcraft, whatever) and use it from there.  Actually, EZ Drummer *does* come with a stand-alone program as well, but it's mainly a virtual instrument.  Complaining that you need to buy a sequencer to use it is like complaining that you need to have a computer or an operating system, or a disk drive, or a power outlet.  Duh!  That's it's nature, and it's well understood.

2) The licensing is not *that* bad.  Here's what it is:  you install the program from the disk, you login to their website and fill in some info including the ""license key"" that comes with your disk, Toontrack generates an automated email containing an authcode that is specific to your computer and your serial number, you type that in on your computer, and you are done.  The bottom line is that you can set two machines up to run with a single copy of EZDrummer.  Then if you want to install it on a 3rd machine you have to de-activate one of the licenses that you had previously activated.

I'm not real thrilled about the licensing.  It is certainly a bit confusing, and I wish it were either a little more flexible or let you license it via a dongle but I've seen much much worse, and I had things running 15-20min after inserting the disk into my machine.  It's actually pretty similar to how Adobe does licensing for example.

Ok, so how is it at helping you create drum beats?  Seems pretty darn good to me.  The ""default"" drum beats are great.  Just select what you want and drag it right onto your favorite sequencer.  That is one way to use it.  And even using it on that simple level it gives you a lot of power.  You can make modifications like how hard the drum strikes are, and you can control the mixer right on EZdrummer itself to tailor the individual drums and symbols.  The other way to use it is to create completely custom beats.  I have not played with that much yet, but that is the feature that distinguishes it from places that just offer you drum loops that you pretty much have to take ""as is"" for example.  And to me the fact that it offers so many different ""upgrades"" is a nice plus.  It means that you can start small and expand, and also that the company is alive and well and motivated to keep making their product better.

I haven't used it enough yet to give a real in-depth review, but I felt like a few of the things that were said about it were pretty far off-base, and I wanted to chime in on that.  I think the real telling thing about EZDrummer is what the real experienced hard-core musicians think of it.  Go and do some searches and I think you'll see that this program has a real nice, well-earned reputation in the musician community.

By the way, I've been using it with FL Studio and Mixcraft and it seems to work very well with both those programs.",5.0

"As a podcaster and radio personality I am always looking for equipment that can help me produce the best sound at an affordable price. When I was offered this set by Aukey at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I was excited to see if it operated as good as it looked. I can honestly say that it does.

The set up is really easy, and even for people like me who are not the most tech savvy, you can get this microphone set up and running in less than 30 minutes. I love the fact that I am able to attach the stand right on to my desk, and that the swivel arm allows me to get it exactly where I want it. The extras that it comes with make it a really good deal, and I never thought I would have been able to get all that comes with it for less than $40.

If you are in need of a microphone and set up for your office or studio that is easy to use, attractive and available at a price you can't beat, then Aukey has something just for you.",5.0
"Loved these at first but lately they don't seem to hold a charge (I've had them for less than 6 mos) and there seems to be no correlation between the red light/blue light and whether they actually have any battery life left.

To say this is angry-making is an understatement. I guess I'll have to spend $100 or more to get decent ones. As a proof of concept, as my first set of wireless headphones, they worked to let me know that wirelessness is a feature that I like.

"I've just returned from a 10-day study tour in Israel, where the Edirol R-09HR (with a foam wind gag designed for a Shure SM-58 microphone over the mics) performed admirably.

It was often in the dust, never in the way, and the Shure wind gag tamed the noise from the top of Masada to the Golan Heights. I was impressed by its predecessor on both live music recording (with the onboard mics and with my RODE NT-4 stereo mic), and with its seamless 24-bit capture of ""board mixes."" The interface improvements (better battery door design, rubberized finish, and the plastic stand) are all well done. I do audio for a living, and this is a sweet little piece of gear.",5.0

"This is a gorgeous cymbal. It has a terrific range in volume and sound character, and registers beautifully on mic. This cymbal is a great reminder that when recording engineers go into studios to record drums, they almost always pass over the $1,500 to $2,000 mics in favor of the $100 Shures and Sennheisers, because those are what work best, and ""that is the sound"", as so many top engineers and producers have said. Likewise, this cymbal outdoes a good number of crash/rides that are three or more times the price, so don't get the idea that by buying it, you're compromising quality for budget and settling for something less. Not at all. This is a stunner of a cymbal with a formidable dynamic range. I've been recording with it for a few weeks now, and it's been a tremendous addition to the studio. Fabuloso superbo.

"This tuner is very inconspicuous in my concert ukulele.  I have used two of the micro clip on NS tuner with our guitars and loved the performance for about a year.  When I got a uke, I needed a dedicated tuner since I don't always play the instruments at the same time.  I thought this may be better scaled with the smaller instrument and as good as the micro.  I'm definitely not disappointed.  It is easy for me to see, yet mostly Indetectable to others.  The display is bright, which will help in low lighting.  It's weight is negligible, but inside the instrument, it doesn't affect the balance as a headstock tuner might.  It is easy to use, not confusing at all.  I hope it holds up at the clip part and lasts.
ETA: two weeks and it's going strong.  I ordered a second for a sopranino uke!
ETA2: clip still great a month in, while this tuner works well, I have noticed that if I'm percussive in my playing, or the uke gets tipped over while in it's case, that thi tuner slips off the lip of the sound hole and down into the body of my ukulele.

"This unit offers great features at a low price. The plastic body packs do feel cheaply constructed but are well designed. I do not think they would hold up to prolonged use without a protective sleeve. Surprisingly the packs have several digital controls such as EQ, Stereo/Mono etc. They run through the two AA batteries in about 4-5 hours of continuous operation.

Either the signal strength of the transmitter is weak or my unit was defective. About 5 feet away, this unit works great and can be hear clearly. However 10+ feet away, the signal starts to randomly cut out with bursts of static. If you are on a large stage, expect very poor sound quality if you are on the opposite side from this transmitter. I also have a SHURE wireless monitor which does not have this problem. At 20-30 feet away, the signal is basically useless. The Audio2000s model is actually better in every way over the SHURE except for build quality and signal strength. However, without good signal strength, the rest is pointless.

Overall, this unit has great features which are ruined by this one major flaw. My favorite feature is the ability to send the signal mono or stereo, which is great for summing mono mixes.",3.0

"I purchased these as a gift for someone who has just started learning how to play the guitar.  He kept complaining that the handmade guitar pick that he was using (AKA an old credit card that he cut into a pick shape) seemed like it would snap the strings.  I wanted him to have something that wouldn't destroy his instrument!

These are great.  You get 10 total, 2 of each color which means you can afford to lose a couple, as is always the case with small things like this.  It's a good assortment, they look nice, they work well for what they're intended to be used for.  The sound, as he plays with these as opposed to his old way is much better and much more full.  He no longer has concerns that his pick will break his strings, which is exactly what I had hoped for.",4.0

"Cons:

Speakers continually have trouble sending signal to each other, sometimes the right channel will have no volume and the left will be incredibly loud, unplugging the usb and resetting everything sometimes solves it, other times it goes away eventually but then comes back.

The left speaker is ungrounded somehow and will buzz intermittently when playing music.

These speakers are not very well made.

"I LOVE my new KLIQ tuner.. I have been a musician for over 50 years and gone though all kinds of tuners for my acoustic guitars. In the last five years I have gone through an Intellitouch, a Boss TU-10 and two different Snark models. The Boss and Intellitouch burned through batteries, worked intermittently and the screens were so small and dark that I couldn't read the tuning info. The Snarks drove me crazy - had to fiddle with them to get a reading, the batteries kept losing their connection, and the dial wouldn't light up enough to get a reading. I bought my KLIQ and can't believe the difference. It activates right away as soon as I clip it on any of my three vintage acoustic guitars or my Gibson banjo. The dial is extremely bright and easy to read! The use of incremental bars and a circle light when hitting the correct tuning note really helps with accuracy of tuning. And I love the cool light sequence when it shuts down! This is the best acoustic guitar tuner I have ever used!",5.0
"I started with the subdude, gamma, mopad:  and now I have all gear, including the rack, on Great Gammas.  What an amazing change these made in my listening environment.  Unwanted bass harmonics and resonance are gone, the mid-range has cleared up, and even with mid-range receiver (due for replacement) is producing sizzles, tophats, and triangles as never before heard from this unit.  I use a space between two Great Gammas for routing the power cables, and subdudes over the crack to prevent the signal cables from getting close.  A space between the Great Gammas and the wall provides a conduit for the power cords.

I live in an apartment with carpet over concrete floors (note those of you with sound rooms in basements).  I had no idea how much sound wave energy was being communicated through those floors and producing standing waves.

There are some improvements I'd like to see, for instance the LCD is hard to see, it is not back lit, I'd like to be able to break songs down into sections to practice them without going through the whole song, and the TV function seemed a little underwhelming, but I'm highly satisfied that this machine was worth the $200 I paid for it.",4.0

The sound of it isn't as loud as I would want it to be It's way too quiet for my liking. I mean it does the job, but just barely. Probably like everyone else, I recommend investing in a much better one. Obviously no one is trying to pay at least 30 bucks for a simple goof, but if I would have known I would have just spent the 30 rather than spending what I spent on this and never using it again.

"I can not believe I got this guitar for $75.  This is a REAL guitar, albeit a student guitar.  Came in a nicely cushioned box with very cool artwork on it.  Guitar comes strung up and ready to play out of the box after tuning.  The tone on this is shockingly good for the price.  I have built a few guitars and do a lot of guitar repair and this thing is flawlessly constructed.  No fret buzzing.  The joints, binding and the finish are perfect.  I read a previous review saying the fret board is NOT wood, this is NOT true.  It has a rosewood fretboard with black binding on the sides and inlayed fret markers.  Yes, there is no truss rod, but its rare to find a truss rod on a classical guitar.  Please note, this is a classical guitar which means the strings 1-3 are nylon, a big thick neck with the octave fret where the body meets the neck.  New strings are a cheap and easy upgrade to the sound of this guitar.  Please know that because of the nylon strings a classical guitar is unlikely to stay in tune very long for first 1-2 weeks of playing, its just the way it is.  Honestly, the tuners are probably the weakest part of this guitar, but it does tune and stay in tune very well for a $75 guitar.  If you are looking to learn to play classical guitar and have a budget...BUY THIS GUITAR.  That said, this is NOT a steel string acoustic guitar, so if you're looking to learn to play more of a Johnny Cash, rock, country-style then buy one of those guitars.  It seems like people like to learn on these guitars because the nylon strings are easier on fingertips, but they really are different instruments.",5.0

"I've used this on less expensive strat style guitars, which often have hum problems.  I like this foil because the adhesive is conductive.  Also the foil is fairly thick which makes it durable when you're pressing it into place, it won't tear.  Also being copper and fairly thick, you can solder a ground wire right down on the surface.  There's videos online that show how to use this.  It's not that hard and can really quiet down a noisy guitar.  In a nutshell, you take off your strings, take off your pick guard and pickups.  This tape is applied to the inside of the guitar cavities, and the backside of the pick guard, forming a shielded enclosure for you pickups, pots, switches and internal wiring.  Cuts the hum or ""buzz"" way down.  Makes your guitar quiet, so you only hears the sounds that you're playing.

Update: I ordered again, this time for an American Standard Strat. It already had conductive paint, but still had a little hum in the 1, 3, 5 switch positions (single pickup selections).  I had taken it apart to do some wiring mods, so while I was at it, I used this copper foil to completely line all the inside cavities. I think this newer roll was just a little thinner, I'd guess 10% less thickness than the same item I ordered before.  But it was fine, actually a little easier to form into the inside corners, and plenty sturdy enough. Sine the adhesive is conductive, it's no problem if you have little gaps here and there. You can just make little patches as needed.  Make sure to ground it and you're good to go.  Oh, one thing to watch out for, the output jack might get shorted to ground if it touches the copper foil (yes I shielded that cavity too).  Easy fix is to put a piece of black plastic electrical tape around the outside of that contact for the tip of the plug.  And yes, it did quiet down almost all of the hum in the 1, 3, 5 switch positions.  It also quieted the humbucker positions 2 and 4, so you can still a difference.  Then again, when I'm using high gain, I always use the bridge and middle pups.

"I record live musical instruments using Audacity on the computer and needed a solution to the problem that Windows 7 has an inherent audio latency defect. When using the Line In audio jacks on a PC with Windows 7 there is about a quarter of a second delay between the time you hit a note on an instrument or sing into a microphone and when you hear the sound come out of your speakers. This makes Windows 7 useless for live recording or karaoke applications. Microsoft's tech support went so far as to suggest that the problem can be solved by using a shorter cable between the mixer and the PC. My rough calculations show that the cable would have to be 46,500 miles long to cause a quarter second delay, but that's getting off the point, which is to review this Behringer USB device and not to criticize, no matter how justly, the arrogance of Microsoft.

The UCA 222 is described as an ultra low latency audio interface. Since high latency is the problem I was trying to solve, 30 bucks or so seemed like a reasonable gamble to me.

When I received the UCA 222 I first tried to run the driver setup on the provided CD. It didn't work, giving an error message that the setup wasn't functional for Windows 7. I couldn't find any Windows 7 or 64 bit OS version of the setup program on the CD. So I thought, what the heck, I'll just plug it into the PC and see what happens. Voila! Windows said it detected and installed the device with no problem. I thought, hmm, fine, but let's see if it actually works. I hooked up the mixer and my headphones and picked up a guitar for a test. Bingo, no latency problem so far. The notes are coming through as fast as I can play them.

The next test was to actually record a new track in Audacity playing along with a pre-recorded track and see if there is any latency.

Ugh, the same old quarter of a second delay showed up in the recording. However, Audacity - and most recording software - has a latency control where you can adjust it's latency period. With a little trial and error I found that setting it to -275 resulted in  perfect synchronization between recorded and live tracks. THIS SOLUTION DID NOT WORK PRIOR TO GETTING THE UCA222. No latency or buffer adjustment in Audacity was able to eliminate the delay.

So.... I'm a happy consumer. This low cost UCA222 gizmo from Behringer did exactly what I hoped it would, and solved a difficult problem which was rendering my expensive new PC more or less useless. Furthermore, no setup was needed. Just plug it in and you're good to go!

Speaking of plugs, the USB cable on the UCA222 is about 5 feet long (I haven't actually measured it, just an approximation) so there's plenty of length to route it around from your computer to somewhere else on a typical office-sized desk. The UCA222 is small and light, though, so you might want to use some velcro to keep it in place wherever you locate it.

There are, however, a few points to consider before purchasing this product. First of all, when it's plugged into your PC, it routes all of the PC sound through itself, instead of through the Line Out and Headphone jacks of your PC. If you have a 5.1 or 7.1 sound card with analog jacks to a sound system with front, rear, side, and sub-woofer speakers you won't get any sound out of them while the UCA222 is plugged in. (The sound comes back when you unplug it, though.) So if you want to hear sound through speakers you have to hook your sound system up through RCA jacks on the UCA222 and those are only single Left and Right channels. This wasn't a problem for me since I use a different PA system for live monitoring but it could be an issue for someone else.

The other thing is that the speakers don't shut off when you plug your headphones into it. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me since my sound system has a mute button on the remote, so it's not too much effort to just mute the speakers when I want to.

The UCA222 comes ""massively"" bundled with a bunch of audio effects software on a CD, mostly freeware stuff you can download off the net. I looked at it, but there was nothing really of use to me, personally. But I got this thing for the hardware, not the software, anyway.

All in all, if you want a very simple low cost solution to the Windows 7 audio latency problem when recording live input from an external mixer, and can live with plain old stereo instead of surround sound output, or with having to unplug the UCA222 when you do want to just listen to your surround sound system, or you don't mind the headphones not automatically muting the speakers, then, like me, you will be very satisfied with the performance, and simplicity of installation, of this product.",5.0

That is exactly what I think is key when looking for headphones you need to find the right headphone for the kind of music you listen to. For me I listen to all kinds of music and therefore I needed headphones that could handle everything.

This headphone handles bass very well, it's actually very good. It also performs very well with the highs the only slight drawback is with the mids where it's a little muffled but still sounds great. Altogether this is a great headphone and you will enjoy what it offers.

"this pedal sounds great! BUT, it comes preset with a volume boost which is non-adjustable. I will now search for a tremolo with a volume control. Sold my Boss TR-2 because of volume drop, got this and got volume boost - I want the volume to be consistent with signal without pedal engaged. Called Demeter to inquire about the volume issue - said I could send it to them and they would adjust it for $40 (not even sure if that includes shipping!) - gee thanks but NO thanks, another bill just to get a normal volume. Not impressed with this company at all. You should look elsewhere for a quality tremolo, IMO.

UPDATE - got a Black Cat Tremolo (slightly used for about $100) and it sounds great - also, has a BOOST CONTROL so you can set the volume anywhere you want, a TONE CONTROL which is nice, and a DUAL SPEED CONTROL.

"After using some $20 Altec Lansing PC speakers for the last 10 years, I decided to get some ""real"" speakers as I am now listening to FLAC files and wanted a nice reproduction.  I had read about these monitor speakers on several audiophile sites, and the price reached $120/speaker, so I decided to buy 2 and go for it.  I also bought Hosa Stereo 3.5mm Male - Two XLR Male 3m 9.9 feet lines to attach to the computer.

Unpacking them, you forget how big these speakers are compared to dinky PC speakers.  Be sure to check the dimensions of your desk so that there is enough space.  They are also recommending positioning the speakers 30 degrees in your direction.  Set up was a cinch, but remember that these are active speakers with amplifiers in them, so I did not attach to another amplifer.

Here's what I noticed:

1) For all the bass fiends, sorry, but don't expect these things to ""thump"" like an 80s beat box.  I've listened to Massive Attack's ""Karmacoma"", which has a catchy riding bass lane, which is very prominent on systems like a Bose (in my car) and in my $20 wired headphones.  However, the catchy riding bass is not as prominent here, and changes the song completely.  That being said, it is more prominent on the more compressed version of the song from ""Collected"", though still not as prominent on other systems.
2)  That being said, the bass and treble for the most part complement each other well.  While I wouldn't say that the sound was ""flat"", it definitely was rich without being overwhelming on either end of the spectrum.  Playing Bad Company's ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love"", the opening guitar riff was boisterous, with a good bass complement.
3)  Mids stand out the most on this speaker, and are great for symphonies or female voices.

Overall, very glad I bought these.  For $120 each, you would be hard pressed to find such a nice speaker.  It is also a good reminder of why to buy a real speaker and not one of those dinky Bluetooth/portable or PC speakers everyone is into nowadays.",5.0

"I don't know why this microphone and similar microphones come with the supplied cable because it requires Phantom power otherwise it will not work...
With that being said, I like the sound it delivers and the size gives it the look of a $2,000.00 microphone for only $38.00.
Don't compare the quality to the expensive microphones but it does sound good and looks amazing.
I have bought smaller microphones on amazon for $18.00 and they sound about the same so basically you're paying for the larger size and cool look.
Just remember, they all require Phantom Power even the microphones that claim they will work with a 1.5 volt battery...NO WAY....In fact, there's not even a slot for the battery so the descriptions are misleading..
Some similar microphones might work with 5 volts USB???",4.0
"I only needed one strip and one fuzzy thingy from this set, but I'm glad I bought this.

"I have been an amateur guitar player all of my life.  I grade myself as an intermediate player.  I have had a couple of practice amps that were solid-state with built-in various effects.  I thought they were okay, until I played this.  Gain, volume, base, treble and mid-shift makes a wide variety of customized sounds.  When run through a tube preamp and send it to the speaker you get a genuinely authentic sound.  I own a larger tube amp and know the difference.  All of the analog under and overtones are there.  Unbelievable volume and sound in a small and simple package.  Want extra effects!  Buy a pedal.  You simply cannot beat this little amp at this price.",5.0

"One could go on for pages about the technical aspects of this amazing keyboard.  I will try to give a more personal account of the things I think put this machine in a class above the rest.

The Kronos is impressive in its sound quality and the scope of the sounds offered.  I have had numerous keyboards (Ensoniq, Roland Juno Gi, Korg M50, Roland Fantom X, others) but the sound quality, especially on the acoustic piano, was always a little dull and ""synthy.""  This keyboard, with its 8 second long piano samples, blows all the others out of the water.  Stunning.

Fortunately, they also included a first class organ sound engine, impeccably duplicating everything from church, to pipe, to jazzy, to distorted rock organs.  You can set it up to use typical organ drawbars if you are used to that.  And the leslie sound is extremely controllable and authentic.

The string sounds are beautiful, ranging from individual instruments, to small quartets to full orchestras.

The synths are what you would expect from Korg, only vastly more varied and intricate since they have incorporated several synths engines in this keyboard, and they can be layered in combinations that provide astoundingly deep, complex soundscapes.

The inclusion of Set Lists is one of those simple ideas that makes the entire keyboard more user friendly.  You can use these for your favorite programs, your favorite combinations, your tweaks to factory programs, all your favorite keyboards, all your favorite horn programs, etc., etc.  Or, if you are playing in a band, you can list the programs in the order in which you will use them in your show, rather than having to write down the order or having to manually enter the program number.  You also get to write a description of how to use the sound, chord changes, etc, which is easily readable.

The graphic interface is also such a relief.  No more hunting through menus, using a knob to select something then hitting enter, etc.  Your choices are laid out in front of you and you simply touch the one you want.  You want to adjust something, just touch it.

Having Karma, which actually uses an intelligent interface to observe what you are playing and play along with you is incredible.  I know it sounds hokey, but that's because you're probably thinking Casio.  Karma can play drum parts, bass parts, string arpeggios, harp runs, and way, way beyond.

Having a drum part (which, of course, you can change) assigned to each program/combination is fabulous.  Playing Steely Dan?  Use the shuffle beat.  Playing Supertramp?  Use the Rock 8 beat.  Hundreds of perfectly recorded drum parts, dozens of different drum kits to chose from.

The only downside to this keyboard is that it is a very complex machine.  You will need to consult the manuals (yes, there are two of them) to wade into the weeds if you want to do complex programming.  It took me 45 minutes to figure out how to reverse the pan on a drum set yesterday.  But I was able to do it, and save the kit.  But that complexity pays off in sound quality and variety.  A song I previously recorded on 6 tracks, I am able to play live on this keyboard, complete with keyboards, synths, drums, congas, echo on the keyboard, reverb on the drums.

As a professional musician said on a YouTube video, ""this could be the last keyboard you will ever need.""  Highly recommended.",5.0
"I just got mine the other day and have been checking it out.

This pedal offers a consistent sound across the whole range of my bass and lots of ways to manipulate it.

The fact that this pedal can be very subtle is a good thing especially when playing with other musicians however you can still pack a punch on the low end. I feel like it sounds best when you use the Filter Twin with some compression BTW.  If you are looking to have a little fun with the sound of your bass in either an accompaniment setting or for a feature - and you can spend the dough - this is worth checking out.

But for the love of God, don't forget you have to be a bass player first.",5.0

I think the ocarina is supposed to be in the Key of D. The one I got is closer to E. It is completely out of tune.

Pay a little more and get one of the more recognized brands like STL or Songbird.,2.0

"This does a solid job at what it's supposed to do: hold my drumsticks and keep them close by. I currently have 4 pair in the bag. I don't think it would reasonably hold more than 6 pair, especially if you try to keep your sticks paired. It could be a little deeper, but that's a personal preference; I've never felt like the sticks were going to fall out of the holder, and the listings photos give a very accurate view of the bag.
I have it attached to a cymbal arm. I like the two tightening knobs of this version. I have seen others that have just the one screw. The two screws give you more variety with the thickness of the bar/stand/support you attach the bag to. The material is heavy and sturdy, and it feels like it will hold up to a lot of use. Since I attached 6 weeks ago it hasn't moved. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because I don't think you could reasonably keep the advertised 10 pair of sticks in it without it being crammed full, which would make accessing them quickly very difficult, which is half of the reason to have the bag there in the first place. It's a solid product, and I would buy it again.",4.0
"It does work effectively with one LARGE caveat.

Pro's: It passes all info to the iPads.
Con's: continuous controllers info COMPLETELY PARALYZES units receiving that data, which I presume is due to the limited bandwidth of bluetooth. I'm still researching, but the first time I sent volume/espression info down the pipeline, all hell broke loose; glitchy digital noise, frozen notes, etc. I'll revise this review if/when I figure out how to thin the data stream or buffer at the iPad itself. I'm running AUM with five plugins; Moog Model D, Moog Model 15, Arp Oddysei, iSEM, and Moog Animoog. I can play all plugins on separate channels simultaneously, but when I play a single plugin on only one midi channel and use vol/exp pedal, chaos ensues.

"I bought the Cannabis Rex to replace the stock speaker in my Jet City 2112rc. The amp comes with an Eminence Designed speaker, but it's not great. The treble is harsh and the lows are okay. After putting this in and taking it to rehearsal, it's a completely different amp. Not only is it louder (higher decible output) but it's also got a beautiful fuller sound. Highs are crystal clear (not shrill) and lows are full and powerful. It's really well rounded and works especially well with some light dirt and being pushed by my Rat. Excellent speaker replacement for $100. Sometimes it's not your amp or your tubes that suck, it's your speaker. It can make a huge difference to do an upgrade.",5.0

I bought the model with instructional computer disc and power adapter, with headphones, even though I didn't need yet another set of headphones, but I needed that instructional video.  This is like going to be the perfect beginner/learner machine, and if I get bored, eh,..oh well, it won't have cost me much.  $$$$$***BUT I DID sort of want the casio 77, nearly same thing, but for the India market, since a reviewer over there on that amazon page claims that the organ feature sounds much more realistic(supposedly) where the 76 organ sounds cheesy(I have no idea if that is true), apart from having about five to seven different tones and music that is Indian, but its possible the organ sound is different, since the 77 box shows ""harmonium"", meaning in alot of parts of the world means ""accordian"", meaning in slang term squeeze box.  I might later order a sa 77, just due to the different sounds and maybe the harmonium specific sound when switching between piano and harmonium/organ, the big orange button, if that is the difference, since I would like to study and play accordian later.  If anyone knows for sure, make sure to share a comment.****$$$$$
One thing I do know, that this item is small enough to be great for anyone to practice, learn, etc laid right across your lap or taken anywhere, where other more expensive models are great surely and not really much more than a hundred to several hundred dollars, this can be right across your lap anytime.  Plus, from what I am seeing, I am not seeing some of the more expensive models having organ capability for some reason.",5.0
"Is the the best pedal ever? Not even close. Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do? Absolutely! I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound. It can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay, rockabilly sound. It's not super versatile but if you're looking for a little depth and color for under $20 then this is what you need.

"I bought this to use in a high-end karaoke system and it works very well.

Physical build: It is complete with an unbalanced cable (1/4"" phono plug) to connect the receiver to the amplifier. The headset is not adjustable is size and the microphone comes with a wind shield. The cord plugs into the receiver with a nice locking ring which looks pretty rugged. The receiver has two stubby antennas.

The receiver fits in a performer's pocket or clips to a belt with a good springy clip. Both the transmitter and receiver are right sized - not too big and easy to travel with.

Operation: The range of the system is amazing. I was able to walk 100 feet through the venue we were performing at and there was no interference or loss of signal. The UHF radios are able to cut through stage sets and building's walls to reach the receiver. There are two switches on the transmitter. The first switch turns on the RF transmitter and the second turns on the audio. This makes it easy for the performer to mute his/her microphone while still keeping the system running silent. The microphone is pretty good quality but requires careful positioning to avoid the performer's breath. Once set in place the microphone tends to stay in place letting the performer move about and gesture or dance with both hands. We ran the transmitter for four hours and the batteries showed no evidence of running out of power.

Note: The MU3 references the RF frequency which is 484.55 MHz. You can run many different wireless headsets and handheld microphones as long as you coordinate and get different RF channels.",5.0

The HISONIC HS120B really fit the bill and the price was very good. It got its first try out at our September meeting. Had no trouble and the members really got to use it also as we passed the mike to them.
The only glitch is the head mike. It is hard to figuire out how to wear it. It sure doesn't fit the top of my head. If you wear it around the back of the head it doesn't keep the mike in position. I would like a better head mike. Does HISONIC have a better head mike?",4.0
"Understandably, the other reviews express their disappointment in the fact that the mic does not come with a battery - so you'll be needing a CR-2032 battery along with purchasing this...

NONETHELESS: The value is unbeatable. I used the mic extensively with Griffin's iTalk & my iPod  to record motivational lectures, and the sound quality was significantly improved vs. not having used a mic with the iTalk. That said, this comes with a high recommendation, if you can deal with having to buy a battery once every couple of years. Sony definitely lives up to its reputation with this product.",5.0

Nice!!.. Great quality cable,5.0
"You can really get good tone out of this amp in both channels. It's actually hard to get bad sound from this thing. The mid shift feature isn't gimmicky like many are, it's actually very useful and helps the amp cover a lot of ground tonally. You can dial up pretty much any sound you're looking for from sparkling clean all the way to metal. This doesn't sound at all like the cheap $50.00 amp that it is. Now this isn't going to rival a good tube amp, but for a little solid state practice amp it's stellar. It will get loud enough to make your neighbors hate you if you're an apartment dweller, but you can turn it down as low you want without losing any tone since there are no tubes, just what you need in a practice amp. If you play live with a band you should probably get this amps bigger brother so you don't get drowned out by the drummer and everyone else though. The only negative to mine is it hums pretty loudly when idle even at low volumes, especially in the lead channel. My G&L with p-90's seems to be worst offender, but your mileage may vary.",5.0

"I'm not going to recommend this over the $15 capos. It's better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made. I decided to try this one out, but the construction of it makes it feel like it's going to break if I pull it too hard.

"This is an excellent keyboard stand.  It is a little more expensive than others out there, but it is far more stable than other stands I've been looking at.  The top of the stand is extremely deep from front to back, so any size keyboard or stage piano should easily fit on it.  It can support a large amount of weight, so even some of the heavier stage pianos shouldn't pose any problem.  All in all, this stand is everything I was looking for.  I had to wait for Amazon to get it in stock and ship it to me, but the week or two of waiting was well worth it.",5.0
"This was received speedily and I put it together equally fast.

It looks decent and I use it for my 2 dreadnoughts and 1 classical guitar.

The areas/guides where the guitars rest are made of some sort of molded plastic.  If you are concerned about vinyl interaction with your guitar's finish (a concern for some high end newer and many older instruments), you might want to cover these areas with a piece of fabric or old sock.  I asked the manufacturer via customer service about this but did not get a reply.

It takes up less room than 3 individual guitar stands and the instruments are ready to play.",4.0
These are not for gypsy swing. The material is softer than other thick plastic picks therefore there is lower volume and sacrificed tone you'd expect from your guitar.,3.0
"I had a chance to play with a few different reamers before I bought this one so I knew what I was getting into.  It works well, is sharp and easy to hold.  Even if you don't make your own reeds and just use commercially produced reeds, a reamer is still a good idea.  Many reeds you buy have sat for a bit and the hole becomes a bit oval.  Also being able to ream a reed just a hair more can help make a slightly flat reed just a wee bit sharper without scraping.  If you make your own reeds, well! you need a good reamer!  Amazon also sells a Fox brand reamer that is cheaper, but I found this one a lot easier to hold.  Everyone's hands are different, but a good grip is important when you are doing something as delicate as working on a bassoon reed.  I highly suggest you find someone that owns a few reamers and give them a try before you buy.  There are straight reamers (like this one) and the spiral ones (which I found too fast for my liking); try before you buy if you can, but if you can't, I found this one to be quite nice.",5.0

"Infinitely preferable to leaning your guitar against whatever surface is at hand (only to watch helplessly as it slides to the ground), this gadget does a great job of giving you a safe and secure place to temporarily rest your guitar. The only two caveats are that it won't clamp to anything very thin, so music stands are out (assuming your stand is strong enough to stand up to the weight of your guitar), and if you plan to use it on a non-carpeted floor you might want to keep something handy to put under the guitar to give it some friction and reduce the chance of it slipping (a spare cushion works).",5.0

Pros: powerful LEDS. Very colorful, high output lights, run very cool to the touch, good price! DMX Master/Slave works extremely easy. :)

Cons: Very cheap plastic casing, flimsy brackets, short power cables (you get what you pay for).

Overall I am very happy. I ordered 6 and 2 weren't up to par (pun intended). One of the lights is completely cracked all the way around. Then one shorts out. If I don't set the power cord just right, it shuts off. (Short circuit). I wish I could have them replaced.

"I own about 15 guitars, all ranging in value from about this... $100, although I think its worth more, to $2000. I play out of a vintage VOX tube amp that I got for a steal. When I go to grab an electric, I grab this one more often than any other, despite having a '61 Gretcsh, a beautiful 12 string Danelectro, a '71 American Strat, etc. etc.
It's finish is gorgeous and just screams ""Play Me!"" and it sounds nothing like your average tele knock off. With the amp I own, I can make just about any guitar sound like any other guitar, to a degree, but again, this baby just screams play me and it delivers. While it doesn't exactly sound like a tele, and of course an actual telecaster would be better, for the price of this guitar, there is no reason not to buy it. I'm not a guitar expert, just an average player and a collector, but I know a good guitar between a crappy knock off. This is a great guitar, I love to play it, and it has a dynamite sound for 99 bux.
The brand is ""Huntington"" which is something I would never pick up in a shop, but after looking at the reviews, and having always wanted a tele in my collection, I couldn't pass this up and I'm glad I didn't.",5.0
"For the price I must say this is a pretty amazing instrument. I'm a full time singer/songwriter and was looking for a bass to record demos at home.  This is perfect!

Excellent Quality! Arrived very fast. 2 day turn around even with free super saver shipping!! Was playable out of the box but I lowered the action and had to give a slight turn to adjust the neck tension. Intonation was already spot on though! And if you've never done a set up before it comes with the tools and instructions you need to do a basic set up for yourself so no worries = )

Would recommend this bass to ANYONE, EVERYONE from some one just learning to a pro who just wants something new to mess around on!!",5.0

I even tried fitting my 5 string LTD bass in this bag. Slightly too small for that, but if you had a 22 fret bass it might fit. The padding isn't the thickest, so I don't recommend this bag for gigging. I bought it for going to and from practice which is probably the intent of this bag. I'm happy that all my instruments fit in one bag.",5.0

The distortion can get as heavy as you like with the distortion boost, also you get better harmonics the higher this setting is.

The low tone knob allows you to really controll how heavy u want it to sound.

I've only run it on baterries and they really last long, the construction is really tough so you don't have to worry about stomping too hard.

Also gives you a nice crunchy sound if you dial all the knobs down for a mellow solo

"Got it for my daughter, who like to play rock and heavy metal on her electric guitar.  She loves it.  Don't need an amp, as you can send the headphone out to a computer speaker system.  It has an aux in so you can play a song from your phone or computer into it, and play along with that.

"I'm a saxophone player with a pinched nerve in my neck that started after about 40 yr of playing.  I just can't have a sax strap on any more.  This is the best solution by far that I have found.  I'm 6 feet, 240 lb. and I would like the saxholder to be a little bigger but it works fine as is.  The construction and materials are high quality.  The shoulder arms need to be thoughtfully bent to fit your shoulders per the enclosed instructions.

The arms click into place to stay together while playing but the click detent is not firm and the arms will seperate when your geometry and the weight of the horn make them.  The workaround for me is a small elastic hair band (scunci, scrunchy?) which stays in place just above where the arms attach to the center piece and provide just enough pressure to keep the arms together.  Another reviewer mentions fashioning a bracket from coat hanger wire which also works but the hair band is just as good and less fuss.

To use this with bari, and depending on how you bend the shoulder arms, you may need longer cord.  Fortunately they include extra cord along with instructions on how to string it through the unit and the buckle.  I used most of it to allow plenty of adjustment all the way out for bari, or in to play alto or soprano.

The ""pad"" that presses against your solar plexus rotates to vertical or horizontal as well as telescoping up or down.  I find vertical and all the way up are good for me.  The hook that attaches to the horn is beautifully designed for secure stay and quick attach  To sum up, this is a brilliantly executed piece of kit",5.0
"The Hamilton guitar stand arrived very quickly.  It holds my Gibson 335 safely but I really ordered it to go hunting with.  I ordered the black stand to use as a shooting stand for my crossbow.

"Purchased for my daughter.  She said it was the best Christmas present she ever received.  We own and play several recorders including multiple sopranos, a couple of altos and a tenor.  Some are plastic/resin and others are wood.  This instrument has a great sound and is solidly constructed.  It is crisp, clear and sounds a beautiful (high) tone.  It is one piece and did not come with a cleaning wand, but it is plastic and can be washed easily under the tap. This recorder is super tiny.  I am an adult male with medium sized hands and cannot play this instrument because my fingers are too big for the tiny spaces between the holes.  My daughter is 10 and she is able to play it with ease.",5.0

"I bought this bag for my Seagull S6 original (dreadnought body shape). The bag fits just perfectly the guitar leaving some room available around the neck and headstock (it will not fit larger body sizes like jumbos). It has very thick padding all around, and the manufacturing is well made (thick padding doesn't leave space around the body). Front pockets are not very large though, but they are enough for storing picks, capos, music sheets and other small accessories. Lightweight and easy to carry. In my opinion, the only 'cons' is that the shoulder straps for bringing it as backpack are kinda thin and not very sturdy as the whole bag. Overall, this gig bag is great, very protective and light, cool style too.",5.0

The violin is a very nice beginners piece with all you need to get started. Tuner pins on all strings is a cinch. Nice case and bow.,5.0
"This is a simple foam case with a thin zippered nylon cover that serves to secure the case in place of a latch.  The same case is being sold under various maker's names, so the only consideration is price, and it does appear that the  Lanakai  price is a few dollars less than what others are charging.

 I bought mine to house my Lanakai tenor uke, so I was surprised to find that it wasn't a perfect fit; the uke slides around in the case a little, though not enough to create a problem. The nylon cover is a bit thin, and I don't think it's stand up to a lot of abrasion, but the case should do a serviceable job of protecting your ukulele from serious damage. I do like the side pocket, which is generous enough to hold several Jumpin' Jim Beloff uke books or a stack of 8-1/2x11 sheets. Just don't stuff it too full.

I wouldn't put a $500 uke in it, but it's perfectly fine for my $130 tenor. Not a great deal, but a decent one.",3.0

"First off, I use Logic Pro X.  I was using a Nektar LX25 because of the space saving and it was great but I soon realized I needed more keys.  Since my experience with the LX series was flawless I decided to check out the P4.  It looked a little pricey compared to its competition but I assure you this thing is in another league.  This isn't a cheap plastic lightweight controller with toy-like feeling keys.  This is a solid well built instrument.  I noticed in other reviews that there was limited integration with Logic, they must not have it set up properly.  I have a ton of instrument control, not only transport and mixing as some have said.  Also, the feel of the keyboard in my opinion is great. That was one of the big selling points for me.  If you are not happy with the feel then just adjust it... I didn't like the response out of the box but I adjusted it to my playing style and I love it.  I hardly touch my mouse anymore using the P4 and that was my main reason for buying it.  After using the P4 for a few weeks I realize that it was a deal for the price.  I recommend that if you have a problem with the P4 make sure you have it setup correctly and know how to set it up to your liking.",5.0

"Purchased the Crescent Electric Bass for my daughter for her 18th birthday. She'd been asking for a Bass for quite some time, and after looking, I opted for this product due to the very reasonable price, along with the packaged items that came along with it.

Once it was delivered, I looked it over, plugged it in, gave the strings a few plucks, and boy! The sound was fantastic, the quality and workmanship was perfect! I expected it to be damaged during delivery or find some little thing wrong; as has been my luck in the past with other products (not from this vendor); I found not one scratch, not one speck of dust... the Bass was in perfect, unscathed condition.

The ear piercing squeals of delight when she opened her gift assured me that ""old mom"" had done good! Many thanks for such a great product at a very reasonable price. My daughter is truly appreciative of this guitar.",5.0

"I bought this tuner in Jan.  I test it against my other tuners and verified it was accurate.  At first, I was impressed how quick and easy it was to use.  If I had written the review then, I would have given it 5 stars.  I used it once a week for about 6 weeks.  On the last day, I tuned my guitar but forgot to turn it off or take it off.  About 30 minutes later, I noticed it and took it off.  At the time, I thought it had simple turned itself off.  Sadly, it never came back on again, even though I tried new batteries.  I also tried the battery in another device and it worked just fine.
After checking the Korg website, I was surprised to learn the unit appeared to have no warranty of any kind.  I contact the seller and was told the same thing.  Let's just say that I will not purchase another Korg product of any kind ever.  Save your money and buy something else.",1.0

"I purchased two of the SKB powered speaker cases, as replacements for my Gator powered speaker cases.  For the most part, I am super happy with the SKB cases.  I love the way the front (loading side) of the case opens (like a giant ""U"") so you can just lay the speaker flat in the case- very easy and convenient to load.  This is the biggest improvement over the Gator case.  The expanding dolly handle is a nice improvement, but already, after just a couple of months of use, it doesn't always slide in and out without a little coercing.  As is always the case with almost every wheeled bag, the casters are a bit small and underbuilt.  For once, I would like to see a powered speaker case with some adequately sized and commercial quality casters.  My only complaint was that the front (underside) plastic ""footing"" (that keeps the case level when standing upright) broke off of both of my cases within a month or so of use.  Not well attached.  It doesn't really adversely affect the case to not have it on there- but a bit disappointing to have it break off so quickly.  It just doesn't hold up well to being loaded in and out of a vehicle.  Overall, a very nice padded case for your 15"" powered speakers- with just a few small improvements, it could be a really great case.",4.0

That being said, the interior is well padded and it should do a nice job of keeping s 3/4 size guitar safe. This case is protecting a Gretsch Jim Dandy, and it fits like a glove.

"I purchased this violin after 10 years of borrowing school instruments, and after a few months with it, I'm pretty satisfied with it.

The violin has a design that I like very much that makes it feel like a regular violin. However, it does not come with a shoulder rest, none of the ones I had could fit it for some reason. I was able to find one that did eventually, but the inconvenience was notable for me. The sound it produces when plugged into an amp or to your headphones is wonderful after you change the strings. The strings aren't that great and you'd eventually want to get a better set. My violin's bridge seemed to be raised fairly high as the strings were good distance away from the fingerboard. Other reviews said that the strings broke upon their first tuning, but I seemed to be lucky and could tune them really easily.
As an electric violin, the acoustic sound is horrible, but it serves its purpose for so I don't bother my neighbors with my playing. It's not completely muted and does make a notable amount of sound but no where near to the sound of an acoustic.

The case isn't too bad, but it's not that great either. It isn't too tough, but it's better than nothing. That said, I would recommend finding another case if you expect it to take a beating. I do, however like the design of the case, and the straps are a big plus for carrying it around.
The bow is something that I really did not like. It felt cheap, flimsy, and just not suitable for playing. I replaced it with another bow, and it felt much better to play with.

The headphones are a very cheap pair that you will likely replace with your own, but it is a nice bonus for them to throw in.

Overall, the violin is very good and for the price, it is a worthwhile investment until I can afford a much better violin. Some things I would recommend you replace, such as the bow and strings, but the violin itself is an excellent product.",4.0

"I have used the Zyex as my standard set for the past 8 years. Wonderful set of strings. Break in time is fairly quick. They last forever (4-6 months easy of heavy use). Every violin responds differently to various sets of strings but I have found the zyex to be the most compatible with the violins I have and used. The tones are rich and vibrant. Slightly on the deeper/warmer side, which I like. The G is plenty powerful and the strings are very forgiving if you are on a off day. I have gone through the entire Pirastro series, the Thomastiks, Corelli, other D'Addario etc. and this is definately my standard. I plan on giving the Larsen's a try next but the only strings I have found comprable are the Eva Pirazzi and Obligatos (which are twice the price) for my main instrument.",5.0

"I received this guitar in good order but broke the high E during initial setup. I put new strings on, they tuned just fine, and I then enjoyed myself with this guitar for the next three weeks or so. Then one afternoon I picked it up and it was fretting out. So I looked
down the neck and right at the neck joint ( 12th fret in this case ) the fretboard looked like a ski jump. It looked as if the neck joint
had slipped down. So I decided to do some research before attempting a truss rod adjustment. However before I got around to
attempting the adjustment I noticed the soundboard had developed a crack about an inch to one side of the fret board not quite
extending into the radius of the D hole. At that point I packed the guitar up and sent it back to Amazon and they gave me my money back. Yes this guitar sounds and plays great. But a 600.00 ( 655.00 at the time ) guitar shouldn't warp or crack unless it's being
abused.",2.0

"How many times have you bought an effect or a gadget like this for your guitar, take it home and find yourself totally disappointed? If you're lucky, you may be able to return it for a store credit at best. Well, after leaving the guitar store, I sat there over a cup of coffee and thought, what did I just spend $39.99 on?  A little plastic box with a brown sticker to make look like a ""cutsie"" miniature Vox amp head, a jack and a few control wheels.  However, I really needed something to plug into late in the evenings because my neighbors don't seem to share my appreciation of music.  Looking at the Amplug, on the back, it appears it was Made In Japan.  ""I thought that's interesting, some of the best effects were manufactured in Japan like the original Tube Screamers and Boss pedals, maybe this would turn out OK"".

Finally got home, installed the batteries, plugged it in and nothing...  The batteries include with any of these devices are usually ready for the recycle bin straight out of the package.  New batteries and WOW!  I've heard AC30's before and this little device actually sounds like one.  I was very surprised at the dynamics and the openness of the sound.  It has three wheel controls: volume, gain, and tone.  Turn up the gain and you get a nice Brian May-type overdrive.  Dial the gain down, turn up the tone and volume and it's very Beatles mid 60's clean.  I was very surprised at the lack of compression.  I've heard the other two versions of the Amplug(classic rock and metal) and didn't like them because of that ""over-compressed"" sound.  To me, they were fine if you really like the distortion factor but with this AC30 version, you can take it from clean with nice high-end boost to a useable overdrive i.e. SRV, without the coloration of the guitar's true tone.  The literature claims it uses analog modeling and it must be the case.  True-digital effects have a very cold sterile sound quality.  This has a warmer analog-tube feel to it.  Again, this is a $39.00 device, it has limitations but overall, it appears very well designed, somewhat frail looking but sounds better than advertised.  Whoever designed the modeling circuit, got it right. I've used it with a '63SG Jr., '74SG Special, and custom built Strats with Kinman pickups and I'm more and more impressed with tones I'm getting from it.  There's a lot of tonal flexibility with the three controls.

If you get one of these Vox Amplugs, use a decent set of headphones, it really allows you to hear more of the harmonics.  The only criticism I have is that it could have been constructed of heavier plastic for better durability. Other than that, it's one of best devices of any sort for guitarists that I've seen in a long while.  You'll end up using this a lot more than you can imagine.  Comes in very handy if you're out demo-ing guitars.

"Banjo stand? Seriously? More like a mandolin or fiddle stand. I would give this stand 0 stars if I could since my Deering Eagle II resonator banjo does not even come close to fitting on it.

"This ukulele is made of laminate and appears to be coated. Unsure if it's paint or some sort of plastic, but the coating arrived chipped at the seam where the neck connects to the body of the instrument and chipped more when I handled the instrument. It doesn't appear to be structural damage, just cosmetic. That's a little disappointing, but something I can live with and honestly I just bought this to practice on. Pics included. (Honestly, this defect is something I'm going to use as an excuse to decorate the uke without feeling guilty for doodling on something I just bought..)

Tuning it wasn't too bad.

"I have two zoom R24s, purchased about one year apart. I do live recording of 8 to 12 tracks from condenser microphones. I potentially love the Zoom, but you MUST know about some serious problems with recording long files. Only after two expensive failures, where the SD card contained either white noise or nothing at all, I found this link:

(google this:) 550526-zoom-r24-experiences-problems.html

Apparently firmware version 1.11, which seems to be still shipping after three years, will reasonably reliably give you a blank SD card after recording eight tracks of 24 bits for over fourty minutes. The unit seems to be working perfectly, but you get no data in the end.

The link contains another link which directs you to a software update to version 1.2. I installed this version in both units, and tested recording long files. The white noise problem did not re-occur - but... YOU MUST PRESS the key that resets the timer to zero when you finish a file!!! Otherwise when you press record again - for example after an intermission in a live concert - the unit WILL NOT START until it writes silence on the SD card up to the time that was on the timer. This could take several minutes if you are recording eight tracks!!! Recording will then start, usually too late, and you are left with very long files which are mostly blank.

This is an idiotic ""feature"". The recorder should simply start a new file whenever the record button is pushed.  This is what my Zoom H2 does, and I have never had any trouble recording 4 tracks for more than two hours continuously.

Another warning: Always be sure there are good batteries installed. If there is a power glitch while you are recording you will get an empty SD card. Also the R24 does not store date, time, and the link status when the power is switched off. Leaving batteries in the unit prevents these problems.

Another warning: The preamp gain controls on both my units are noisy. You cannot adjust them while doing a live recording, which is very inconvenient, as adjusting them is essential to getting the record level correct. However, if you exercise them by turning them up and down about 20 times before you start recording they work ok, at least for a few hours.

Another beef: I installed the latest USB driver and attempted to use the unit as an input device to my Windows 7 computer. It may work with some software, but I was unable to get it to work with Adobe Audition version 3.0, 1.5, or Cool-edit pro. The driver does not support WDM. Cool-edit pro running in virtual XP will play a stereo file on the R24, but will not record. The Auditon programs see the unit and allow you to set up tracks, but crash if you attempt to play or record.

Since discovering all this I have made some very successful recordings (as long as I remember to reset the timer each time I stop!!) The units sound very good when used for recording. I do not mix on them, as I have much better equipment for that.

I might eventually like this unit a lot, as it sounds good, is very light and compact, is expandable to 12 tracks, and records on SD cards.

I have been playing classical guitar for over three years, and I wanted to upgrade to a more professional level guitar at an affordable price.  I am also a small adult.

The hand-inlaid mother-of-pearl rosette against the cedar top is very elegant, and the solid Indian rosewood back and sides are just gorgeous. More importantly, however, the guitar sounds great!  The combination of the the cedar top and Indian rosewood back and sides gives the guitar  sweet, warm tonal qualities.  Although the guitar is labeled ""parlor,"" it does have plenty of volume.

They're bright, yet warm and very punchy sounding when fresh. They're also very well balanced in terms of tone and actual feel beneath my fingers. Other strings I've tried can sometimes have too much ""Boom(ers)"" or can sound too thin and bright, or flat and dull. To my ears, the D'Addario's just sound ""right"".

The only drawbacks to using these strings are that  they can take awhile to stretch out and stay in tune with a standard Floyd Rose or Ibanez Edge vibrato system. And, if not wiped down after playing, they can corrode fairly quickly. Although, that could be due more to the northern, moist climate that I live in, or perhaps I have nuclear waste finger sweat!!!

I don't have an endorsement deal; I pay for my stings out of pocket just like you, and for my money, there is no other brand of guitar string! I use 'em, and I highly recommend them!!!

(sorry for my bad english but i'll do my best!)
i use vocaloid4 editor since 1 month and i can tell, its fantastic !!!

even when the voicebank isn't okay, no problem desu !!! you can do nearly anything with the voices...
i use ""gumi english"" version and (i think) she cant growl... but i think its because i'm a noob! i searched in youtube and i saw vocaloids growling with vocaloid4 editor ^^ i just need more skills !!!
...

you don't need to klick each note to enter a word, no, you can just klick on the first note and then write the text down and vocaloid4 will put the words into the melody - very easy !
and the voices going from very high to very low so you mostly don't need to pitch or drop the melody.
with the parameter, you also can ""wobble"" the voice or make it sounds strange and more more more! a lot of presets are including!
but there is one problem: i cant find an ""equalizer"" for ""high"", ""mid"" and ""low"" ... but i think its because of my low skills !!! its not shure that there are no equalizer... even without equalizer, the voice sounds like a human !!! its no joke !!! i finished my first demo-song (my first!!!) and showed it to friends and they asked me: ""who sings that song?!""

you should search for vocaloid4 tutorial videos to learn more about it!

i would buy it again! but i'm a fan of vocaloid-music! i don't know what ""normal"" music-producer would say about it!
i think its great and compared to FL12 (i use FL12 to make the beats) its a bether software! no bugs, no lags, fewer loading-, import- and export-time (with and without beat)

"I am a beginning bodhran player. The tipper  that came with my bodhran was made of wood, very heavy with big bulbs on the end. It hurt my hand and wrist to play with it and slowed my rythym. I noticed on the YouTube tutorial videos I am watching that many of the professional players use rattan tippers. Saw this one on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. I love it! It is light weight and has increased my speed of playing substantially. As other reviewers have said, its a good idea to put a little wood glue on the tip that strikes the drum to secure the wooden rattan straws and keep them from slipping or rotating.  I did that and it not only stopped the straws from moving or rotating, it also smoothed their rough edges as well, preventing a slight scraping sound on the drum.  I also added  another rubber band just below the narrow band near the tip to secure the rattan straws. Easy fixes, really. Because I had to do a little work on it, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But I really like this tipper and at this price  I cant complain!",4.0

"I bought this bass for a few reasons, being the main reason, it is a short-scale, and this has nothing to do with small hands and things like that. If it fits, use it ! I just love the feel of the SS bass.

The other reasons which are my ""pros"":
- the bass is light;
- almost well balanced, still tips over a little but far better than any long scale;
- the body design looks awesome and the contoured and the receeded cuts makes it super comfortable;
- the two sets of pickups produce any kind of sound you need and want;
- no active electronics: it's pure sound you get; (and no batteries to replace);
- price: at $179 it is almost a steal for the features;

Right out of the box it needed adjusting two of the strings to lower the action just a teeny-bit; easily done if you have the correct Allen wrench : it is not shipped with anything - you get just the bass; still was pretty decent setup;
The strings being new are ok; I might replace later with flatwounds just because I like them more.

Cons: any ""cons"" ?
- there is not much wideness in the tone control;

"Cons: 1) It's small. I would compare it to a Dunlop Jazz III, maybe a touch bigger. 2) No grippy texture, I had to put my utility blade to it. 3) The regular pick part of it is too short and too blunt. 4) The grooved slide part is in a bad spot, the wings hit frets.

Pros: 1) The thickness is good. (2.5mm) However in a more relaxed grip, because it's size and it's stiff, it's a little harder to hold on too.
2) The pointy part makes it one of the best if not the best speed picking, leads type pick I've ever used. Awesome! 3) I don't use the rounded edge, but I can see how it would be good tapping. 4) Love the earth marbled color tones.

Summary: $9 bucks for a pick?.. Ok, maybe $3-$5 for this one in my opinion. If you're a metal or jazz player you my just love this pick.",4.0

The Violin is absolutely beautiful and of very good quality for a student/beginner violin.

It comes with a decent tuner as well. (I would recommend getting a better one though.)
Rosin is also good for the price. (I haven't needed to get a different rosin because it works well enough.)
Cons:
The strings and replacement strings that come with it are trash, if you get this violin get some strings like the Pirastro Tonicas.(I can't stress this enough.)
The shoulder rest is uncomfortable and really annoying, I recommend getting something else (I need to get a new one too so I can't recommend one yet.)

There is ZERO movement once closed, the compartment is good size I have a tuner, Capo, extra batteries and 2 sets of strings and picks.  Maybe they have corrected the issues, but either way mine came in perfect.  I paid $44 and would easily pay $80 for the one I got.  I say go for it.",5.0

"UPDATE:  after a half dozen gigs, this unit (transmitter) started popping and making unwanted noises.  It seems to be the output jack where it mounts to the circuit board.  I opened it up and couldn't find anything loose.  I was disappointed to learn that Line 6 does not provide technical support!  They suggest if you have any problems you contact an authorized repair shop.  I tried two repair shops on their list.  Both said they may or may not be able to fix it, but would have to charge for repair because Line 6 will not pay them.  And any repair will cost more than I paid for the unit.

So it is unuseable for gigs now, after only six uses. That's unacceptable.

(original review)

I just gigged with this wireless unit last night for the first time and it was exactly what I wanted and hoped for.  Perfect digital sound, instant set up - just plug it in and play it.

I use it on a bass guitar through an SWR 450, direct connect to p.a.  My bass sounded WAY better than it ever has.  I'm not sure how much of that is due to the digital wireless and how much is the new flat wound strings I put on.  I probably should have done one step at a time.  Anyway, it sounded better than ever - the tone and clarity was astonishing.  No buzzing, popping, no noise whatsoever, even when turning on or off, and in and out of the jack with the amp and volume on.  Pure clean tone.

The transmitter is very compact, fits easily with other pedals in a pedal board.  The led lights are cool too.

One problem, (not the fault of the unit). I was clipping the transmitter unit to my strap at the peg and it fell off four times, landing SPLAT on the floor.  The back battery cover popped off twice.  But no damage, I put it back together and it kept going.  I would like to mount it more permanently, maybe using my strap case, but I trade guitars with another player for some songs using a different strap so that wouldn't work.  I will just start putting it in my pocket instead of clipping it on the strap.  It proved to be durable, anyway.

I recommend this unit, it is a hell of a lot better than the cheap analog AKG, Nady, and AudioTechnica units I have used before and the price is sure right.  It does not come with a power supply, so plan on (a) plugging it into a multi-power 9V, such as a pedal board, (b) using a 9V battery, or (c) getting a 9V 100mA DC adapter, about ten bucks on Amazon.  Be careful about getting an adapter - you need to make sure that the outer shell of the connector is + and the inner pin is -.  Many adapters are just the opposite, and that would fry the unit in a heartbeat.",5.0

"We took a chance and ordered these for Christmas for our kids.  I'm glad we got them in time to send them back and get something else.

The sound was rather tinny, but not the worst I've heard - hence two stars instead of just one.  If you are looking for a real basic, who-really-cares, beat-em-up set of beginner bongoes, I suppose you could do worse.

But the screw that hold the two halves together was loose so they were skewed at an angle, and I had to line them up and tighten them.  The finish was awful.  There was lacquer applied to the surface of the wood, and it looked like it was done in a hurry by a child - glops and drips and missing sections.  Worst of all, it seemed that they put the lacquer on first, and then they roughly carved the groove in it to put the metal band around the bottom, because the wood was chewed up and splinted, and I actually got a splinter in my finger when I picked it up.  And on top of that, you could tell that the skin tops were real skin, because one had a big defect right in the center of it, so much so that I feared it was a weak spot and might rip.

I wouldn't even give these to my children, they went right back in the box.",2.0

I bought these as an upgrade for my mid-80's Fender Strat. The straplock screws are slightly smaller than stock so they would not have been solid. It was easy to add some slivers of hardwood dowel to the holes in the body and then use the new screws. There are no instructions included. One thing of note is that I also bought the Schaller versions of the same thing for my Les Paul: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L3FPUG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

The moral is they are interchangeable so I can have one strap and use it on both the Schaller and Fender units.,5.0

I bought these strings for my Scott Cao 850 Soil violin. I decided to take a chance and take the advice of another reviewer. I love how much louder my Cao is now with these strings! Granted I normally play mariachi music and I am usually the only one on violin. That being said I have to project as much as possible without sacrificing sound. I will say the G and D strings seem to have a dark sound but I love the A and E. I had never deviated from Tonica as they are tried and true for my needs. I'm glad I took a chance.,5.0
"Ignore the negative reviews; this is a great musical instrument for beginners, intermediate players, for those with limited space, for those on a budget, and for those who need to be able to play with headphones (although the included headphones are poor sounding - go out and buy better ones to appreciate the excellent piano sound on this). First, the grand piano sound is VERY good, the best in this price range. The keys  are not weighted but they are touch sensitive and will do for all but the professional concert player. The speakers are stereo. Get a sustain pedal (not included) if you want an even better piano sound. I bought this for the piano and I am very satisfied.
There is plenty of (what I call) junk here,meaning lots of effects, cartoonish voices, etc. I guess if you want to play around with science fiction sounds, you can do that with this but I don't see any value in that. I can't imagine anyone spending more than a few minutes with some of the 300 voices included here. But the strings are good, the choir and organ is good, the harpsichord is okay, the horns and classical guitar are good. Why anyone needs a tweeting bird or a car crashing or a train on a keyboard is beyond me. I find the many ""style"" settings (with auto percussion, bass line, etc.) pointless, also, unless you want to play in some lounge somewhere. I wish I could have bought a cleaner interface without all the ""junk"" that few people will ever use.
But I bought this for the piano and it is a winner. Try it on headphones and see.

"As a beginner level player, I do not have much experience with synthetic-core strings, so I was excited to try out the new Fiddlerman string set. My regular violin already has relatively new strings, so as a test, I replaced the steel strings on my ""back up"" violin. The difference in tone quality was remarkable; my thrift store violin actually sounded nice with the new Fiddlerman strings! These strings cost less than many of the better quality steel strings but have a warm tone that you will not find in most steel strings.

I will definitely try the Fiddlerman strings again the next time I need to replace the strings on the violin I usually play. Disclosure: I received a string set at a discount in return for a review. But I also purchased another set of the same strings; these strings are a good value at their regular price.",5.0

"I have a set of these installed on my project guitar with a double locking tremolo. Most may wonder why use locking tuners on a double locking tremolo? Simple: For easier quicker string changes. Plus these tuners look freakin' sweet! The build quality on these tuners are bar none with silky smooth action in the tuning pegs and locking pins. Besides that the greatest thing is the drill free installation that can be had with most 6 inline necks when installing this with the Universal Mounting Plate. This came in super handy and made the installation a breeze.

Are there any cons?  Yes it doesn't make me a better guitar player. Lol But seriously, if I have to find a con I would really be nit picking here but notice the straight 90 degree angle of the screw hole to fasten in the tuners?  This maybe a problem for some as it may mean drilling additional holes in your headstock. However if using the Universal mounting plate or installing this on a fresh headstock this isn't a concern.

All things considered, I'm totally sold on these tuners and recommend them without hesitation!",5.0
"This speaker solved a major tonal issue for me. Speaker is designed to have a vintage Marshall type of sound. Has really strong bass but very tight, no flubbing on distortion of low notes. Has slightly mellow highs, cured the ice pick high problem I was having. Previously I was using a Celestion 10 inch Greenback which is a beautiful sounding speaker, however it was flubbing out horribly on low notes. This speaker can really handle the low end since it is also for bass. It also has a really great quality to the distortion in the mids with my setup. Very bluesy. Not sure if it will be the speaker for everyone but I am selling my greenbacks and keeping these. Not sure what the reviewers are looking for who said the speaker sounds cheap. The sound I am going for is deep and focused in low mids, a mean woolly blues sound. The speaker does it for me and does not sound cheap to me it sounds raunchy :-)
One thing to note, this specific Mod speaker, i.e. the 10-70, has a different tone than any other Jensen MOD speaker. I generally do not like the Jensen MOD speaker line as I find it to be harsh and strange sounding. If you listen to the sound clips on the Jensen site this speaker has a different character than any of the other speakers. If you look at the description of the tone on the Jensen site this speaker model description has a different set of tonal characteristics than the other MOD speakers. This is the only Jensen MOD speaker that I would personally recommend of the ones I have tried. Have not tried all of them.",5.0

The hardware is very heavy duty, as well as the case. The removable lid is awesome, & the handles wouldn't break if you tried! To say I am happy with this purchase is an understatement!!! If you're thinking about getting it, stop thinking & buy it, you WILL NOT be disappointed with it, & you can't find anything this good for anywhere near this price! P.S. Its a little ""new smelling"" when you get it, so open it up & have a fan going for a few hours. That is truly the only ""bad"" thing I have to say about it. Thanks Odyssey!!!",5.0

"I had been looking for a nice cymbal boom stand at a variety of different music stores and all of them were pretty pricey. The cheapest one I found was about $45. Then I came across this and thought it was a great deal so I figured I would just go for it. Let me tell you this, these boom stands are great! Not only were the stands perfect, but they also came in almost 2 days early! The only problem I have with them is that the felt rings are slightly thin so you cannot tighten your cymbal all that much. However, that is cheaply and easily fixed so that's only a minor issue. Other than that these stands are a steal!",5.0

I had a custom Gretsch C.G. knock off made that made it look great. Intonations was very dicey due to a cheap nut that caused binding & pinging of the strings. Had that replaced. The pots are cheap and have had 2 or those replaced. One of the redeeming factors which made this guitar addictive to play was the neck. It has a feel that makes you want to play it all day.

Bright, even light. Flexible shaft makes it easy to position where it's needed. Good strong clip grips a variety of music stands and piano music desks just fine. And unlike some much more expensive lights, it doesn't block my view of the conductor over the top of the stand and below the light. So far, seems to charge quickly and stay bright for a long time. Do note that the supplied charger is not rated to run the light, only to charge the battery.",5.0

"I've been wanting a condenser microphone for some time to set-up an online-recording rig for podcasts and the like. I'm not an audiophile and haven't done any professional recording, so I'm basically a layman who's very new to this. From a purely aesthetic level, the MPM-2000 is impressively-built for the asking price and has a classic 40's/50's quality about it. Initially, I tried using it with a lower-end USB to XLR converter (again, my experience level is pretty low), and that didn't really work...at all. I'm guessing that has to do with the Marantz requiring phantom power (48V) to work. If you're picking this up and expecting to just be able to connect it directly to your PC, you're going to be disappointed (and you're going to have to buy additional equipment).

Using the MPM-2000 with a Tascam DR-40 portable digital recorder yielded much better results (it would have been difficult for it not to). Sound is very clear and focused, with virtually no incidental background noise popping up anywhere. The included pop filter did a good (as in, noticeable) job filtering out any ""plosive"" sounds in the recordings and I guess it's keep my mic spittle-free (I haven't really used it enough to judge how effective it's doing that). The included case is very durable and is amply-padded, so it should be more than up to the task of protecting the MPM-2000 while you're taking it on the road or have it in storage.

As a total package, the MPM-2000 seems like a very good buy for the price. If you're haven't had experience recording with XLR microphones (mine was very limited going-in), you'll likely need to make additional purchases to be able to use this microphone as it's intended, so do your homework and make sure you have what's required beforehand.",5.0
"This was my first experience with a ukulele and it wasn't terrible, especially when you concider the price, this thing was awesome.. except for one thing. I couldn't even get through one song before it went out of tune. Two of the tuners on the uke I got had a conciderable amount of play in them (you would turn them a bit before the peg would actually turn). It is possible I just got one that was made on a Friday afternoon when everyone just wanted to head home, I don't know. What I do know is that I'm sending this one back and upgrading a bit (a luna mahoghany series tattoo uke). Bottom line is, if you want a really cheap relatively solid uke that will give you lots of practice tuning, this is THE ONE for you! If you want one you won't need to tune every couple of minutes I'd keep looking.",3.0

"The only reason that I am giving this 3 stars is because of the customer service experienced thus far. The product did not work on arrival. The built in amplifier was malfunctioning and the bass was completely un satisfactory, out of phase, and quiet. I test the woofer with another amp and it worked flawlessly. Customer service was great, I called up and within 5 minutes we both agreed the best solution was to send the amplifier back, and have a new one shipped to me. Rockville is paying for shipping both ways so my expenses thus far are 0.
Anytime you recieve a product and it doesn't work is always a bummer. I run a mobile DJ business and have a gig this weekend. At this point the customers who specifically requested, and payed for, additional bass requirements are now going to be very angry with me. I guess I should have known better purchasing a lower tier product such as this. I had high hopes for this thing seeing the good reviews here on Amazon, but anytime you receive a brand new product and it is not functioning properly tells you that the company producing it has some serious quality control issues.
Besides not working, there were also several other problems I noticed upon unboxing this product. First of all, there were screws missing that are required to mount the front grill. The bracing at the bottom port was also off center and looks kind of goofy. Inside the port I also noticed mold... not just a small amount, a serious fully rampant mold problem inside the enclosure. Not only is that a health issue, it probably says something about the environment these are stored in, and probably has something to do with why the product does not work. There is also no form of grometting/padding where the woofer attaches to the baffle plate, which leads me to believe that air leaks are a real possibility with this enclosure. It's an easy enough fix I plan to address when the amp returns.
Other than these fairly serious issues, there are a few things I am pleased with. Overall the construction and bracing of the box is decent, probably better than what you could build yourself. The amplifier unit LOOKS nice, and feels of reasonable quality. The woofer is very impressive, with high quality push connection terminals and an enormous magnet/voice coil assembly. Feels very solid. I can tell that when I get this thing functional, it will have some serious balls.
 At this point, I cannot recommend this product for someone who is in pressing need of a reliable source of bass. If you don't mind screwing around with the return process and waiting several weeks for an item you expected to have working in a week, then don't hesitate to roll the dice with this. You get what you pay for, buy quality or buy twice and that's exactly what has happened to me.
I will update this post when I receive the new amplifier and get the product functional.",3.0

"This was my most disappointing Amazon purchase I've had in 20 years. This company shouldn't even be allowed to have trading partnership with Amazon.

First thing to address, the service. When I purchased this item, the condition was clearly listed new. I don't ever post product images, but this certainly won the award of exception. As you can see, the boxing itself is a disgrace and has clearly been passed down from customer to returning customer. The product tag also states it has been around since 2008. I can't really say much besides the obvious home tape, the rips and tears, the stains and chppings on both the Luna Guitars product box and the item itself.

I know what Luna is capable of. Aside from poor treatment of this poor ""3/4"" scale, this guitar line was pitiful like a spit in the face. I'd like to start off saying that this is actually more a half size than anything, the measurements are off are listed and advertised. I have owned 2 3/4th scales from different guitar companies, and being a player for a decade, I know what they should look and sound like. This 1/2 size was so small that even I, a 5'2 female with petite hands couldn't play, dare I wonder how a grown man would even begin to strike a simple power chord on this thing. The frets themselves were so cheaply saughtered that the ""glue"" of object leaked to the sides like melted cheese. This rushed/poor job also caused the edges of the neck to be pricking my palm on every scale (no pun intended). Even considering softer nylon sounds, I felt like this having called an acoustic is a misjudgement. My electrics unplugged are louder than this toy. The intonation is horrible as well, I had to retune it every 4 hours. The action was also way too high and definitely needed custom bridge adjustments to it, at the very least. Lots of other work including the frets needed generalized repairs to even consider a basic tune on this. The gig bag was free, so beggars can't be choosers unlike some whiny brats that expect a $40+ value on something included with the bundle packaged deal. You will get a floppy outer case with minimal protection (if any) on the instrument and will probably not fit an adult. I even struggled to put the backpack-styled straps on myself. Luna really misleaded us by labeling this as a ""travel"" guitar. Even having it as a children's would be a crime. I was certainly hoping giving all of these the benefit of the doubt that this particular model was abused from past players, though when I stopped by a local Luna dealer to see the others were no different, so don't be fooled. This would be great for your 4 year old toddler playing ""Mary Had A Little Llamb"", but otherwise I wouldn't have paid a penny over 1/3rd the price ($50) new for it. I urge you to take this review to heart when I say don't waste your time, and invest in a full sized guitar instead, for any age. I'm not a large male nor a child and it still just doesn't work, no matter how hard I tried to make peace with it. Full sized Luna's have offered quality and sound great for their product line prices, but this has had the tables turned. Thanks for reading, and good luck on finding another that suits your needs.",1.0

"...you will find this DAW to be the best environment to create your musical reality.

"When the Harmony-M that I ordered arrived in the mail, I set it up in my home studio to try it out and hear how it sounds.

As far as quality goes, the harmony voices and effects are excellent. I also like the flexibility of being able to save your own presets.  It has a rugged chassis and seems to be well-built.

But I found two negative issues that have me returning the unit and looking for something better.

The first issue is that the volume of the third harmony voice is too low in volume.  The second harmony voice completely overpowers it.  In fact, if I set the third harmony higher in pitch than the second harmony, I literally can't hear the third harmony (and I am a veteran studio engineer by trade.)  Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the volume of the individual harmony voices relative to each other.

The other negative issue I discovered is that the unit's sensitivity is automatically set all the way open.  I kept hearing this annoying swirling/swishing noise coming through, and it turned out to be the Harmony-M trying to generate harmony voices from the faint hum of my furnace on the other side of the wall.  There's no reason for a harmony voice generator to be THAT sensitive.

I suppose it's possible the Harmony-M I received may have been defective, but regardless, I'm going to have to send it back.  It would make a great second harmony generator for studio use, but it's definitely not going to work for my live applications.",3.0

"I use a Kustom Profile II for smaller venues like churches and nursing homes. I play guitar and sing. The original speakers weighed in at 25 pounds each. The weight and material provided great booming bass if I needed it. But what I needed was light weight, easy to move and set up passive speakers. That is where these Rockville's shine. at 13 lbs each, they're easily transportable. If you still use 1/4"" phone jacks, you will need to purchase new cables, or at least Speakon to 1/4"" adapters to use these. They are about $10 each at a big box guitar store. Sound: These are not my Kustom speakers. Setting the two side by side, the Rockvilles lack the depth of bass, the mid tones are ok, and the highs are just as sharp as the Kustom. So, I have to dial up the bass on the amp to get the sound I want. Build quality:  Poly cabinets, look like they'll last awhile. There are no covers available for purchase. I called the company, they were very friendly and responsive. These are unpowered speakers, which are becoming more rare as companies are moving to powered speaker systems.

Other than that, this is exactly what I expected.  The material on the humidifier itself is very soft rubber so there are no worries about dinging up your finish.  Also, the clip is coated in a soft rubber so if you clip it to a sound hole rather than using the clear cover, it will also not scratch up the finish.  Another thing that I like about it is that you can clip it in the sound hole and not have to take it out to play if you aren't using the hole cover.

The sponge was easy to wet and seemed to be pretty quick to do so.  No syringe to deal with.  What is nice with this one is that you get a humidity indicator to actually see if it is working.  It is a little tough to read where pink meets blue but it is better than nothing.  You can really only read 3 different levels of humidity with it (Humid, Safe, and Use Dampit).

Overall...it is pretty basic but it seems to get the job done.  The bonus is that you get the sound hole cover with the humidity indicator if you really want to target the humidity in the body.",5.0

The output is great, the feel is incredible, and they are easy on the frets.  Also, if you like to bend a lot like I do, it is a breeze with these (just like basically all Ernie Ball strings).

"Disclaimer: I do not claim to be an audiophile or expert on audio

Pros:
Excellent midrange - The midtones on these sound much warmer and more fluid than on any pair of headphones I've owned.
Comfortable - one of the only pairs of headphones I've owned that I can wear for hours on end without any discomfort
Detachable cord - extremely handy as I tend to take this with me a lot, and built-in cords inevitably start to fray after extended traveling, so having a detachable cord is extremely useful for me.

Cons:
Very poor range - these tend to cut off the high end of the audio range, and there's no real bass to speak of
The cord it comes with does not have a 3.5mm connector",4.0

"This is a pretty good mic. The sound is clean and good for vocals among other sources. It is a relatively quiet mic, much quieter than some cheaper mics, but no where near my AKG C414 XLS.

Sound quality is great, no complaints. I use it for vocals, guitar (electric & acoustic), and it has a very true-to-life sound that makes it usable for pretty much anything.

I know it's easy to get caught up in how a mic ""sounds"" but I unless you are going after a very specific sound, a sound that is caused by the microphone (warmth, smoothness, etc), you should think of mics as trying to reproduce the source as accurately and cleanly as possible without distortion, interference, or coloration.

"The Good:
Solidly constructed. It feels sturdy and well made in my hand. The tripod seems able to securely hold the mic under average use conditions.

The Bad: Perhaps I got a defective product. However the sound quality is terrible. I have to shout into the microphone for the computer to even register that I've produced a sound. Adjusting the button on the front seems to increase the loudness of the background noise but does little to improve the quality or volume of my voice. Further the construction of the tripod feels cheap in comparrison to the microphone. Its quite a bit lighter, and I have no doubt what so ever that knocking the USB cord would cause the whole thing to tip over and smash into the ground.

In Short: Bad sound quality, bad volume, bad tripod, good solid feel to the mic itself. Wish I hadn't bought it.",1.0

"Item delivered with only its retail package (without an extra box), but the unit itself hold well. I think it shows the build and the quality of the machine has passed the UPS delivery test. Just so you know, the machine doesnt come with fog juice. You can easily buy some ready-made, or you can make your own. There is a log of information out there you can find.

The principle of a fog machine is very simple: a holding tank, a heating element, a pump, and a fan. The bigger the wattage, the faster it heats up, the more fog it produce.

"Buy this for the tap tempo that is not present on the smaller (and still awesome sounding) Flashback delay pedal. MUCH easier to use since it has tap tempo built in to the delay with the foot button on the right. Also, the inclusion of a few user defined delay's (programmed using the phone app) is pretty neat.

The looper, though, needs work- as some other reviewers have pointed out. You're delay will not carry over when you flip the switch to ""looper"" mode. Once in looper mode you are limited to the knobs for delay level/time/feedback. It's a fun distraction at first but it quickly becomes difficult get consistent results. For instance: Say you're in delay mode and are onto a seriously cool delay sound and guitar lick. Wanna loop it and build something fun to jam? Not so fast. Flip the switch to looper mode and your delay you spent so much time on is now gone. You will also lose tap tempo ability. Wanna change the delay settings mid loop? Not so fast. You're limited to fine tuning the delay through the knobs (which feels like simple trial and error) and will not have tap tempo.

In summary, the looper is frustratingly short sighted- especially given the size of this unit. A few minor additions/tweaks would have made this pretty stellar all-in-one delay/looper. I would have preferred this unit not have looper capability and cost a few $$ less. I suspect many will look a little stronger at the Line6 DL4 unit instead because of this. Personally, I'll stick with this X4 and add in their awesome Ditto (or ditto X2). Should be much more ""complete."" The probably just didn't want to cannibalize their Ditto looper sales.",4.0

"I have had these for a week, and I will certainly update the review if anything changes.

Three out of the four are smooth turning, but the fourth is a little ""notchy.""  The overall quality seems fine for the price.  I am not using the geared 5th tuner as these are on an Irish tenor banjo.  The 5th peg is certainly not smooth like the geared tuners on my other banjo's.  They are chrome plated which matches the rest of the cheap hardware on this banjo, so while it's not what I would prefer it works out well in this case.  The plating is even, and smooth.

Tuning with these is uneventful, and predictable.  Just the way you'd like it to be.  There is no slipping, or lag in the response to adjustments.  I am able to tune very precisely even with the low GDAE tuning of the Irish tenor.

If the action was smooth on the whole set I would have given 5 stars, but the quality control is clearly hit or miss.  Still completely serviceable.",4.0

"I give it two stars because it does work. It powers up and it clicks in metronome mode and shows the pitch in tuner mode. And I give it two stars because as a metronome it is completely useless and that is what I bought it for.

Let me explain that statement. A major feature on this device is the presence of both in and out ports. It almost seems like you could be able to plug it in between your guitar and your amp and/or pedals. And you can. But even with both ends plugged in it still defaults to clicking from its own tiny speaker. You can press the mute button and then metronome goes into the out jack (which makes no sense by the way, since my amp is guaranteed to be louder than this thing's speaker). But then you realize that the volume of the click that goes into the out jack is very low and even playing quietly drowns it out and the volume control on the side of the device only controls the volume for the device speaker and not for the out jack. And the headphones jack on the side of the device doesn't actually pass any signal from the in jack, so it is completely useless.

To summarize, if you plug this thing between your guitar and amp and play out loud, amp will drown it out. If you intend to use headphones you are out of luck because you will either hear your guitar or the metronome, but not both. The only way this can be useful is as a tuner or as a metronome for an acoustic if you play kinda quietly and put this thing close to you. But I practice on an electric guitar with headphones and I cannot use this thing at all. And while it is a reasonable tuner, I prefer vibration based clap-on tuners and I have two of those.

"I saw this item on Amazon and it looked like an answer to where to put all of the LP's.  We inherited a stereo from my uncle and we had a few old LPs and then got a ton more.  I would have ordered it immediately but the description didn't say where it was made.  I contacted the manufacturer and received a wonderfully quick response letting me know it's made in the USA.  When I ordered it I didn't expect it to arrive so quickly nor did I expect it to be so nice.  Right on the front it says made in California, USA.  It's carpeted inside and out.  It has metal feet that slide without marking the hardwood floor.  We loaded up all of those record albums.  We have several BOXED sets which are large and we even got them into the case, a little tight fit, but now all of the albums are together.  I haven't really figured out how to take the lid off, but that wasn't a priority for me.  Having all of the albums stored in one place is just wonderful.  There is even room for more.",5.0

I saw this pedal on the Steve Krenz UStream show where he featured Johnny Hiland who is one of my favorite players. Based on his recommendation I ordered one the same night.

The only complaint I would have so far is that after five minutes of inactively the board starts lighting up in what they call Vegas mode.

"It does what it said it would do, and did not immediately break.  This is a good product for its very specific use.  The key thing was that it worked, and continues to work.  The plugs are not deformed, or weird, and the wire was not chewed up or broken.  This allowed the product to work as described.

 I imagine if you cut it or something it would no longer work, cutting the wire is not advised.

Trying to connect the the incorrect receptacles could also cause issues, also not recommended.

In a pinch the product could conceivably be used as a shoelace or something, but again this would only be an emergency use once all other options have been exhausted.

If you need to strangle someone, I think the cord is long enough to do it, again it less then ideal for this purpose, and you should probably just stick to the intended purpose.",5.0

"We have run into some serious issues with Amazon regarding items with the piano. First, there was no power cord. Granted, we bought this as a ""used"" item that stated less than 5% cosmetic damage. When I contacted Amazon, they said that it wasn't intended to have a power cord sent with it. However, 1 person asked if it came with a cord and 3 people responded with a yes. Amazon refused to send me a power cord, but showed me which one would work well with it.

Upon arrival, a key was up higher than the others and wouldn't go down. When we turned it on (with using my laptop power cord), it wouldn't work. We decided that we would try to take it apart and see if it would be fixed before sending it back for a refund. My husband and I literally took the entire thing apart to get to the keys. My husband found that the key had jumped out of it's track and he had to re-insert it back into place. My husband I both are very confident in taking things apart and making them work. However, I don't think most people would have been able to figure this out. They would have been left with a bum key.

The piano itself, once we got the key fixed has worked great. My husband and two children have all enjoyed playing around on it. My daughter starts piano lessons soon and I think it will work for that very well. It doesn't take up a ton of room, and the fact that it isn't too heavy is very appealing. I could potentially take it and move it out of the room if ever there was a need.

So apart from dealing with Amazon and the two hiccups with the power cord and the piano key, this is a good piano and I highly recommend it.",5.0

"This is a good guitar for the smaller player, but you will need to upgrade it if you want it to play well.  Overall it is built well, but the tuners are garbage.  I have had my hands on two of these as I bought one to teach will and recommended one for a 9 year old student.  There's not a lot out there in small sized guitars for a good price.  For my money, they could include better tuners, we're talking 20 bucks, which I would gladly pay for to make this a playable guitar out of the box.  You will need to put at least .10 gauge strings on it for it to stay in tune at all.  I went ahead and bought some tuners (Fender Strat/Tele Vintage Machine Head set of 6) from Amazon-about 32 bucks, and a cheap mini humbucker pickup.  I also had to shim the neck-now it's starting to feel usable.  I'm no expert, I just scoured the internet for instructions and went for it with the repairs.  Not sure about all the 5 star reviews because it really isn't playable until you at least change the strings.  That being said, I don't see there is much out there for the younger player, this is basically it.  Let me know if you find anything better for around the same price!  peace",3.0

"This guitar is so easy to play and sounds great too.  Some other reviewers have mentioned its great if you are smaller frame wise or hand wise, but even for someone tall with long fingers (like me) it makes playing the guitar that much easier.  I loved the sound of my acoustic as well as the ease of the smaller size of my electric.  This guitar is great middle ground.  The shallow body makes it comfortable to put your arm around and while the bridge doesn't seem that much smaller, I've noticed I have a lot easier time hitting chords that are a finger stretch and moving between chords as well.  I really like how the holes are up high vs the traditional directly below the center of the strings.  It gives me much more ability to control the volume level while playing acoustically.  If I need to practice softly, I can strum down low on the strings and the volume is softer.  I was concerned about the sound without the wood back, but its really not an issue. This guitar has a beautiful voice.  It sounds great and plays faster than my other two guitars (Epiphone acoustic and Squirer Electric).  Its beautiful to look at too and to my delight it seems to hold up well being I accidentally already banged it a little and it didn't leave a mark.

It may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a sweet mix between the good of an acoustic and the good of the electric, this might just be the guitar for you.",5.0
"Everybody has their own needs, especially when it comes to guitars. I came across this design by accident on Amazon, while looking for an entirely different guitar (a mahogany top acoustic).  What intrigued me was the dual-use aspect, that is it can double as an acoustic and an electric. To be sure, when unplugged this guitar doesn't project like my Taylor 714CE, but once plugged in it has a wonderful tone that's somewhere between an acoustic and electric sound.  While the on board electronics are not the most sophisticated, they can be adjusted to satisfy both types of guitar sounds.  What I like is that I can connect to my pedal board add some delay/reverb and get a nice electric sound at a stomp, or switch back to an acoustic sound with another stomp.  Very convenient for my gigs, which have a mix of electric-guitar leads and acoustic strumming. Sometimes there is insufficient time to switch back and forth from acoustic to electric, or the lead part is so minor that it doesn't justify bringing both types of guitars. I especially enjoy just bringing one guitar to practice that can give the rest of the band an idea of what the lead part will sound like, well enough to decide which songs we will include in the set. If we will be electric-guitar ""heavy"" on the next gig then I just simulate that during practice and bring whichever guitars will needed for the actual gig.

Once I received the guitar, I realized that the examples of it's use I found on You Tube, were very good indicators of what the guitar is capable of.  That said, however, it must be acknowledged that this guitar, out of the box, requires a good set up to reach its potential. However, almost every guitar, regardless of pedigree will need some setup. Even my Taylor had to have it's saddle lowered and truss-rod adjusted.

If you have a craftsman's touch like I do (and the right tools), then a bit of fret-leveling, a shaving-down of the saddle and truss-rod tweaking will render a very fine result indeed. For example, after set up the action at the 12th fret on the low-E is 2.5 mm and the high-E is at 2 mm (with no buzzing even with hard strumming). That equals the setup of my Taylor, though naturally the unplugged sound is not anywhere as distinguished, which is understandable given that the Talman costs one-sixth of the Taylor.  Again, however, plug the now-setup guitar in and it stands on its own against any guitar of twice, perhaps thrice, the cost. A major purchasing-point for me was the thin neck, which makes playing so much easier on the hand.  Might not be a factor for you right now, but playing for 40 years does take its toll and thin necks become increasingly a need rather than a ""nice to have.""

If you can't do the setup yourself, you have to figure that cost into the deal. A mass-retailer like Guitar Center, might be able to do as thorough a setup, but in my experience, don't count on it.  I had them setup my Les Paul and while they did even out the frets, they couldn't be bothered to re-crown them.  I had to buy the files and do that job myself.  So much for Guitar Center setups.

This guitar serves a particular purpose, and I suppose there are few all-purpose guitars, but if you usually play plugged-in you will have a great little dual-purpose guitar.  Even unplugged, it's nearly as loud as many full-sized guitars and great for practicing to recordings of our gigs while at home alone. Pop it into a well-padded gig-bag and its light weight won't burden you from van to venue and back.

Lastly, the Talman is very well finished, has no surface flaws and like many Ibanez guitars goes beyond functionality by being beautiful to look at and touch. The red undertones of the mahogany body is a joy to behold, and the figuring of the ash top (I have the natural finish, not the red-burst pictured) is likewise very pretty. The cream-colored edging of the body and neck is also nicely done.  The tuners are decent and feel about 14:1 ratio. The strap-buttons needed to be tightened as did the screws on the electronics panel and battery box, but those are minor assembly issues.

The only other change I made was to replace the provided bridge-pins with brass ones (which I do with all my guitars anyway - the brass (being denser) transmits vibrations more easily to the bridge. Speaking of the bridge, Ibanez provided an extra saddle and two under-saddle shims in case you go a bit too far while filing the saddle down. That's more thoughtful than most guitar manufacturers to be sure.  In addition, you get two allen-wrenches; one for the truss-rod and another to adjust the pickup.

Well, if you've read this far you're probably very interested in this kind of guitar and I commend you to order one and see for yourself. Don't judge it only on what it is but for what it can be with a proper setup. Initially,the higher action prior to setup will tell you what you need to know about the sound you can get; the rest of the tweaking can come afterwards.  Remember, almost ALL guitars need a setup; only the most beginning players don't realize that fact. Now, I can finally get back to my search for the perfect (affordable) mahogany-top acoustic.",5.0

"Perfect portable recording device to take on the go.

Pros include, quality sound, portability, 8 x 8 tracks (64 total/per song), tons of features - precision audio/freq editing, effects, etc.

Cons include: the built-in stereo mics record too much background noise, a professional mic is recommended.  There is somewhat of a learning curve, controls are a little confusing, the LCD screen is very small... and every button has multiple functions, almost impossible to know where to start without a tutorial.  I have a degree in Computer Engineering and there is no way I would have been able to figure out the BR600 without video tutorials walking me through the basics.  The manual did not help much at all.  Don't expect it to be studio quality, but its great for demos and songs on the go.  The stock 128MB compact flash card is only large enough to record 1 or 2 songs at the highest quality.

I have not yet had the opportunity to use the USB interface. Will get to that in the winter when I am spending more time inside.",5.0

"This violin is actually a really good starter violin for anyone. It has great sound and it's pretty sturdy.

Other than that this is a really good instrument.",5.0
"Stand stays open through repeated toddler kicks, barely moves across wood floor.
Would suggest putting some of those fuzzy anti-scratch floor protectors (for furniture feet)on the part of the stand that touches the back of the guitar. Hasn't scratched the guitar but worry that it might.

"These units look and feel well made and have a great reputation for outstanding sound quality, which is one reason I bought a set. Also, the multi-stepped tips looked like a good idea to seal out outside sound, provide better sound and stay in my ear better during activity.  Though, not an ""audiophile,"" I still have a good understanding of sound quality and function of earphones as I've owned many.
I must say, that even with getting the ""proper seal"" with these MC3's (or any ear bud really), the sound quality was completely void of any base.  Sure, there's all kinds of warnings in the box on how to install in your ear properly, but even when done, and sealed with any of the three varieties of ear bud tips supplied; the sound is all treble. Which is terrible.
The other thing is the tips the rubber tips slide onto are extremely long and can dig into your inner ear. This alone caused some issue with getting proper seal and may vary from person to person. If you use the typical round rubber tips supplied, between the heavy weight of the earphone and the extended tips they hang out of your ear so far they fall out all the time.

I have realistic expectations and understand exactly how to install an ear bud properly for seal, but these units sound horrible with no bass. If the same design principles apply across the board with their entire product line....I'd not bother buying them. As for my purchase of these ear buds, I returned them to Amazon for a refund.

Seriously, the Sony, Gummy, Phillips (add your brand name here) buds for $19 or < work, seal, feel and SOUND great! With the normal amount of bass as anyone would expect. While using the same round rubber tips no less. Save your cash and buy most any ear bud under $30 to get good sound, bass and no ear digging tips.",1.0
"I bought this guitar based upon the reviews. Unfortunately for me, I didn't have a good experience. The built-in tuner kept indicating the 5A string was flat. However, it was wrong and - in the process of tuning the guitar according to the built-in tuner - the string broke. It was a brand new battery in the brand new guitar, but even so the indicator just kept indicating the string was flat when it was strung each single time. After the string broke, for craps and giggles (really all craps as this is not a giggling matter) I downloaded a tuner app for my IPhone. After using it to actually get the 6E string in tune, I tried checking the built in tuner on it, and sure enough the built-in tuner shows it's flat. Can't get it to budge at all from the flat indicator. So, thanks to a clearly broken built-in tuner, I broke a string.  And there is no way in Hell-o I'm paying to put new strings on a new guitar with a malfunctioning built in tuner.  I will be returning this POS.",1.0

"Works great as a secondary mic holder attached to a boom stand. It is a little heavy for its size, so if you attach it to a boom stand with an adapter be sure to have the balance correct, otherwise it'll tip over the stand.

1. If you really use it as a PA system, use the iPad and run the Star Maker app, at the launch of the song, please press the red start button.  The mic would work as PA system.

"I have been a musician for over 40 years,and have tried many,many pedals over the years,(including the recently offered BeatBuddy),and was STILL looking for a pedal for some ""backup"" for my practice sessions,and in times I gig solo.
The Digitech Trio has finally fulfilled that and does it brilliantly.
I am amazed at the realism of the bass lines and drum sounds that ""intuitively"" follow my lead that come from this little pedal.
The Band in a Box accompaniments of bass and drums are spot on,and as real as they come.
The three parts you can access with the optional 3 button foot switch,or manually on the pedal itself,makes this a dream come true for someone who doesn't have a bass player,and drummer to come over at a moments notice,or when the inspiration for a new song occurs.
It also has built in effects placed if you want/need them for each genre, to give you THAT sound in your head you are looking for.
I still use my Fender Mustang Floor for amp modeling and specific effects,and I added this in the mix ...straight to my mixing board.
I coupled these 3 pedals with a Digitech JamMan looper,and I am a one man band anytime I want to be.
Below is one one my setups for this.
Note this pic shows the pedal setup when I first pulled them out of the box,and I changed a few patch cords,so this is not an example for you to set up your pedal.

"Original review:  1 star.

This is written in the event someone is looking for answers to this problem - there is not much information about it elsewhere.

This upgrade has a serious conflict with the audio device in Apple Thunderbolt displays. Those using such displays with laptops or Mac minis will experience this issue. The display has a monophonic microphone input (the computer's Built-in Microphone has 2 inputs) and Finale won't load it's audio engine when started due to the conflict with the Display Audio having a single input. When the Thunderbolt display is disconnected Finale loads properly.  With the display connected, an error message pops up stating ""The audio engine failed to load. Please restart Finale.""

Neither the 2014a nor the ""vanilla"" version's audio features work in this set up.  So if you use a Thunderbolt display, particularly necessary for large scores, you will not be able to use the program's audio capabilities.  The solution, from Finale tech support, is to _not_ use the external display (unacceptable), use another computer, or use a the previous version (2012) until an update is released. This has a significant impact on professional projects and teaching at our university where we have to have the same software versions in the media labs as in our personal computers.

Here's the communication from Finale tech support:
""As dicussed [sic], Finale 2014a's audio engine is conflicting with an audio device, specifically with the input for ""Display Audio"". Finale 2014 ""vanilla"" did not have the same issue (though had it's own set of issues with some other audio devices) and therefore it may be the best option to roll back to that version. [...] Hopefully our developers can get this resolved in a future update, but for the time being, you should be able to run this version of the software.""

I installed the ""vanilla"" version but it exhibited the same behavior - ""audio engine failed to load.""

Right now, the program is unusable in my case.

------
Update
After a week of going back and forth with tech support they pointed me to the Finale 2014r version, again, and had me install it after deleting all system files of the version I had in my computer.  This solved the audio problem, but then it crashed each time I tried to open MIDI files regardless of how I did it (from within the application, by double-clicking on the file, or dragging and dropping onto the Finale icon) - a common and simple procedure.

------
Update 2/27/2014
Finale 2014 has quit unexpectedly several times while working on a file and when the computer goes into sleep mode. There does not seem to be a single reason I can isolate.

This has been a frustrating and time wasting experience. I am a long time user and am very disappointed in the company and this version of their software. The program has been released with too many bugs that make it not suitable for professional work. The solution of last resort is to revert back to Finale 2012, which works flawlessly (even in OS 10.9.1, Mavericks).

At least, I discovered this now, so we will not be upgrading Finale in our university's music labs until that happens.

------
Update 4/26/2014
I was recently contacted by MakeMusic.com and asked if I would agree to be a tester of the Finale update they are working on, which would solve the above problems.  I agreed and have been using the testing version for several days. So far, they seem to have worked out the kinks with the new audio engine (incompatibility with Thunderbolt displays, etc.). The sporadic crashing saga continues, sometimes with no apparent reason while working on a file (not just after sleep mode). No fix yet. I was told, however, that they are working with Apple to try to fix this problem.  When the update it released to the public, clear of these serious mishaps, I will update my rating. Here's the communication from MakeMusic:
""Hello,
Thank you for the test results. I am happy to learn that you haven't encountered problems with the audio engine in version 4639. We continue to work with Apple on the crash after waking from sleep. This issue occurs in other applications as well and Apple is seeing what they can do to fix it on their side. We have made some changes to minimize the crashes from this problem so it should happen less frequently in 2014b than in 2014a. I hope we will be able to reach a resolution with Apple before long. The crash occurs in the audio engine which is completely new in Finale 2014. The Finale 2012 audio engine is not subject to this crash. I appreciate your testing very much and look forward to your results. Have a great weekend! Thanks.""

------
Update 7/30/2014
Since the re-work of the new audio engine the program has been much more stable.  It does most functions well and behaves relatively well. There are, still, a few erratic glitches and an odd behavior here and there that I hope will be cleared up soon (crashing when disconnecting an audio/MIDI interface, for example - all issues that the 2012 version does not exhibit). Other than that, on my current system (OS Mavericks, Thunderbolt display) the program works. For this, finally, I can give it a 4 star rating.

------
Update 10/2/2014: 4 stars. It too very long to fix bugs and still not 100% satisfied.
After several months of use I have upgraded my initial rating to four stars.  The original glitches caused by the redesigned audio engine have been fixed. However, a few minor problems remain or were never addressed as they have to do with complex notation requirements. Working with tech support, some have been cleared, others are just the way the program behaves.",4.0

"Nice orchestra size acoustic guitar. Solid top, nato back and sides, plastic nut and bridge. Has inexpensive tuners but they work fine for now. Very plain and simple guitar, like the ones made in the 70's. I've owned several different Yamaha acoustics from the Japan and Taiwan era (70s) and have been amazed by their tone. I got a good deal on this one on auction. The new ones are made just as well and hopefully will sound as good with age. The body is smaller than a dread but the depth is the same. Much more comfy to play. I've found to get the most out of these Yamaha's is to put in a bone saddle. I made one for this guitar and it improved the tone and sustain. I'll try some different strings once the originals are used up which should improve it as well. The finish is matte rather than gloss which I prefer. Overall a good guitar at a great price.",4.0

"I travel about once per week, and ordered this guitar to have something to do in hotel rooms.  I was introduced to it by another frequent travel who raved about the guitar. The main things I am looking for are:
i) size
ii) weight
iii) the carbon fiber neck that is guaranteed not to break.  I was also told by the traveler that he rarely needed to tune the guitar because the carbon fiber.

I ordered the guitar, and amazon promptly shipped it.  However, as soon as I took it out of the box I knew I was going to return it.  Everything about the guitar lacked finish.  First, the biggest problem. The neck's coating (likely polyurethane) had several rough spots. This is weird, and the first time I've ever seen this on a guitar (I own 2 fender strats, a taylor, and the traveler EG-1).  The roughness interferes with a smooth transition between positions.  And it's not just the neck...several other spots on the body had the same lack of finish.  It was almost like the coating needed sanding.  FWIW, the frequent traveler I met had a smooth, nicely finished guitar that he loved.  Perhaps there has been a change in the manufacturing process.

The guitar is also quite heavy....noticeably more so than my traveler EG-1.  The weight seems to be in the body, not the neck.

The case isn't quite the right size...it's a bit big at the top, and too small at the bottom at the widest part of the body. The bag wasn't even closed all the way when I received it due to this problem.  I was able to zip it up eventually, so perhaps it was just tight and would ""break-in"". However, I worry that the guitar may simply fall out the side bottom of the bag at least initially.

The size itself is ok.  In its case, it's actually somewhat larger than my traveler.

The main pro is the balance of the guitar.  It is much better than my traveler EG-1 sitting on my lap.

Overall, there are some serious quality control issues. It's about twice as expensive as the traveler guitar series, and the traveler beats it on playability.  As a result, I wouldn't recommend this guitar.",2.0

"I installed this on a Washburn WI-64.  This pickup-bridge cost almost as much as I paid for the guitar, yet the difference it made in the sound was worth every penny - and that was with a passive installation (no powerchip preamp needed, and therefore no battery, either).

Construction: I was pleased to see ""Germany"" cast into the bridge frame of this piece.  Each little saddle-piece has its own wire running down to a very small, etched pc-board from which the lead wire exits to tap into your guitar's pick-up network.  The adjusting screws for each string-saddle worked smoothly yet without any buzzing.  The build quality is top-notch.

Installation, mechanical: I was concerned at first that the body-mounting blocks were smaller than the originals in my Washburn - until I realized that it meant I could simply remove the old adjusting screws and insert the new mounts into the old bridge's mounting holes and tap them into place.  I used a plastic handled tool so I wouldn't scratch anything.  They went in easily and yet securely.  When in place, the new bridge-height adjusting screws threaded in smoothly and with perfect spacing for the new Powerbridge.  Because it was so mechanically precise, I did have to work it carefully to align both sides at the same time - but it could not have been any simpler.  I unscrewed the coil cover off the nearest humbucker and threaded the Powerbridge wire down through the guitar body into the controls cavity without a hitch.  I did file out a small notch so that when I put the humbucker cover back on, it wouldn't pinch the signal lead from the Powerbridge.

Installation, electrical: I soldering the lead from the Powerbridge in a parallel mode to the other two coil pickups, so that it is always ""on"" with full signal.  I can turn the volume on either of the original coil pickups to zero and play with just the Powerbridge sound, or I can blend them in in any manner with the existing volume and tone controls on the guitar.  It works beautifully with the pickups in both humbucking and single coil configurations.  The Washburn doesn't have tone controls for its pickups, instead, it has a ""VCC"" control that gradually sweeps from a full-humbucking wiring to the electrical equivalent of a single-coil via the center-tap of the guitar's two pickups.

Sound: Stunningly rich and complex.  As the first reviewer observed, it's not quite an acoustic sound - but there are so many more overtones, you may sometimes prefer to use it instead of your dreadnaught.  I almost always run my guitars (acoustic and electric) through some kind of stereo chorus, and when I do that with the Powerbridge and listen with a stereo speaker set-up (or better, headphones) it creates an almost three-dimensional sound field.  When I play the ""harmonics"" on my strings, the Powerbridge brings them out better than I ever imagined - not just the octaves and fifths, but even some others that my acoustic has trouble reproducing.  However, I do appreciate having the magnetic coils to provide the ""bottom end"" in the sound spectrum, and don't expect to play it without using it in combination with at least one of the two magnetic coil pickups as well.

Switching/blending: I am so enthusiastic about this, I've posted it before my next phase of experimenting, which will involve drilling a hole in my guitar to add a volume control to the Powerbridge wiring.  It's perfectly usable without that - but I love to tinker with blending - so it's the next step I'm going to take.

(11-1-2011) Finally installed a passive control for it and created a 3-minute video which shows the installation, the wiring, and demos some of the new sounds possible.  I would have linked it here, but links won't post, and I've had difficulty uploading the video to amazon directly.  You can search for it on YouTube with keywords Fishman Powerbridge Passive Installation Tune-O-Matic.  It's on a black Washburn WI-64.",5.0
"I had a Bose Companion 3 II from Costco, but returned it because it made similar buzzing noise.
I searched for the smallest 2.0 system that has real good sound, and decided to give these a try. As soon as I plugged in the power, I noticed buzzing noise. I tried with/without power surge protector just in case, it made no difference. I live in a urban area with stable power source, so that can't be it. Buzzing takes off 3 stars.

I have read from somewhere else that these have noticeable buzzing noise, I thought maybe that guy got a lemon. But mine is the same so I don't think this is a lemon.

I'm just a normal computer user listening to music and play games sometimes. I thought these ""monitor"" speakers are closer to professional quality. Do musicians not care about these buzzing noise?

Another problem probably isolated to just this one unit is that the 1/3 of the tweeter was crushed in. I tried gently pushing it around hoping it pops out, but 1/4 is still stuck. I know audiophiles treat these as if camera professional would rarely touch the lens on the camera for deep cleaning.

I ordered 2 of these speakers, but I didn't even open up the other box. These are definitely going back.
I think I'll be trying Audioengine A2+ Premium.

"For playing and recording at home I literally don't need anything else.  I can get any sound I want out of this with any effect that I normally use.  I set this up in my living room and have not been back to my practice room since then in over 1 month.  It's a beautiful little amp.  The sound quality is excellent, can get clean as you want and dirty as hell.  I can get it to ""sound"" huge while keeping the volume neighbor friendly.  And it is very dynamic.  Using my stock tele and my modified one the amp behaves the same - if I dig into an open chord it gets a deep smooth crunch then I can pick a few notes and they ring out clear and clean all on the same amp and guitar settings.  I've run it on batteries and with the wall wart.  With the batteries it tends to pick up more hum, maybe the wall wart chord grounds it better?

"Wow! I had a set of Piastro Tonica strings and I had to find new strings only a month or so because the G-string didn't match the D-string in sound. THESE STRINGS ARE AMAZINGLY MATCHED! I don't have the A-string issue, but I know from seeing other reviews that if one of my strings has an issue down the road that Fiddlerman will take care of it free-of-charge. I was seriously debating getting Dominants since they are just considered a standard, but I am not a pro and if there are some that couldn't even tell a difference than who am I to spend twice as much?

TONE: very consistent throughout. Even the E-string matches the others in warmth-brightness levels extremely well.

SETTLING: Mine mostly settled in after only a day, but about a week later the settled a little more. It was a little strange seeing them settle more after so long of not changing, but I have only tried four different brands so I am not too experienced with it.

CONSISTENCY: The sound on these is vividly smooth! It is actually making it harder to improve my bowing technique because it makes less of a scratchy noise towards the bridge and it doesn't wisp as much when the bow slides towards the fingerboard.

If you are using Tonica's, I highly recommend trying these out!",5.0

"I returned this without using it.  The primary component of this kit is the piano tuning ""hammer"" i.e. wrench.  The wrench I received seemed to have been used and seemed to have been damaged and perhaps to have done damage to the piano on which it was used.  There were flakes of rust and metal inside the socket (see photos).  Presumably the rust was from the tuning pins of a piano, and it looked like the metal shavings were from the socket itself.  If you've seen a hex socket that has been used on the wrong size bolt and been stripped out inside, you have an idea what I'm talking about.

For what it's worth, the wrench also looked pretty crappy:  the metal cowling ring meant to cover the top of the wooden grip was rattling around loose (see photos).  I don't need a fancy rosewood and brass handle, but I do want a functional wrench, i.e. one that isn't going to round off the corners of the tuning pins in my piano.  This looked too risky to experiment on my piano with, so I can't say anything about how it might actually have functioned had I tried it.  I'd be willing to try a tool of roughly this apparent quality except for the actual star socket, and I may yet try another, more expensive product from the same company.",1.0

"For the longest time I have always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I bought a cheap acoustic from a local music store and I was completely confused, I knew nothing about string gauge or the many different kinds of strings that were available. I settled on a set of Martins medium gauge 80/20's and was satisfied with the sound they produced. I began to learn the basics. like the parts of the guitar, chords, music theory, etcetera. As i gained more knowledge I started experimenting with different gauges. The medium gauge strings hurt my fingers after many hours of holding down on the fretboard. A friend of mine suggested I use extra light or light strings, since I was a complete beginner, it seemed right at the time. I purchased a set of of Martin light gauge 80/20's. I restrung my guitar and began tuning the strings. everything went well, and the sound was bright but did not hold tone as well as the mediums. I found that the intonation was a bit sharp. After several hours of breaking them in the high E snapped. I liked the strings and they were not hard on my fingers. I was browsing guitar strings when I found a set of martin light-medium gauge in phosphor bronze, as soon as I put these on my guitar, I knew I found my strings.

I can hear all sorts of nuances in music that before I completely missed. The highs are nice and crisp and the mids are tight and punchy. The bass at times seems a bit heavy, but this is probably due in part to the fact that I currently have myself in a corner. And I know bass frequencies build in corners. As soon as I've rearranged, I'll edit my review. In summation, these speakers make great upgrades from conventional listening speakers and great first-time reference monitors for small setups like mine. I would recommend these to anyone looking for good solid monitors at a decent price.",5.0

"I ordered this tabla set for my 7 yr old son who just started to learn tabla. We wanted to give him something(definitely not a very expensive one,until he shows real interest and gets serious about perfecting his tabla skills) to practice at home. Tabla set is as described by the seller. It came in a neatly packaged box(It's okay,not a sturdy one)a tabla set(one heavy wooden dyan and one metal byan),base for each tabla(good ones),a book(nice & informative),fabric covers for each(both pink which i dislike)& a tuning hammer.
I ordered this mainly because it said 'student tabla' which I was looking for and the great reviews for the seller.
I was a bit apprehensive because there were no customer reviews for this product,but still went ahead and placed the order on 16th may 2012 and the item arrived on 22nd from India. Everything looks good to me(im no musician!)and my son started playing it as soon as he came back from school! He is excited to get it so soon! No shipping damages or anything of that sort. Will recommend to my other friends looking for the same.
I will further update this review based on what his teacher,an expert, has to say about the quality of this set.

"The original price of $179.95 was deceptive at best.

It was quite obvious that the individual was having a hard time grasping the English language; therefore, he had a difficult time understanding my concerns.  I stated that I wanted to return the item and that I would purchase the item elsewhere because the cheap headphones and instructions were not something that I needed nor did I believe that they were worth an additional $30 as I Googled the headphones and found them selling for under $20....I purchased the item based on getting a ""great deal"" with a $100 savings!! The option of a refund was never discussed and he just stated that he would send me a replacement.  I requested that I receive a copy of our chat conversation and a shipping label; but I received neither (the label was found when I decided to request one again).  I did received a duplicate order, for which I now must go through the process of sending back.  I used the product as a gift because of the time constraints and my money was held up for an unspecified period of time.  Luckily the product itself was satisfactory, just highly disappointed with the false representation of $100 savings...I thought the product was worth more than it was.

"I originally was planning on purchasing 2- 3 packs of xm1800s, but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainer.
I was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song.
I really wanted Sure SM58s, but the budget did not allow it.
I normally stay away from Behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc., but these microphones were a game changer for me.
They have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives, also an excellent output level to the mixer.
I was able to EQ them easily for both male and female vocal ranges. I was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors.
I was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end.

This is the only head that goes on my snare. Very warm, with nice overtones, and a great punch make this the perfect head for many different styles of music.

"Wish I could add 5 more stars to this.  It's been a long while since I had a good mic and decided to get this mic after listening to a live show on youtube and they were using this model.  Man, best $130 ever spent! The gain knob on the back is awesome, like way beyond what I was expecting for gain.  Has omni-drection, Stereo, some weird setting i guess where two people facing the mic in the same direction, and bi-directional options.  Mute on the front and volume control.  The mic is heavy! Heavy as it they took the time to build this mic right and not be cheesy and cheap.  The only thing is every other knob is sturdy but the volume knob was made with plastic cheap mess.  But never the less it's still good! Get it, you will be happy I promise or I will pay for it lol

Has the usb connection at the bottom and works with Winblows 7 up to 10 without any issues.  Has the headphone jack at the bottom as well.  If you run a dual output 3.5 jack, you can make it easier on yourself to plug into your comp speakers and headphones without having to turn the mic all over the place to plug in.

Comes with the stand and has padding on the bottom.  Guys, this mic picks up everything! I mean a larve farting outside will be picked up by this mic if you have a good set up.  No more needing to talk loud and pushy anymore.",5.0

"After a few comparison clips on youtube, I decided that I wanted this thing.

Pros:
It's very affordable - probably the cheapest pedal on my board, and if it breaks, you can just treat it like a disposable razor and buy a new one.
It's versatile - from medium/heavy overdrive if you fiddle with the volume knobs on your guitar, all the way up to face-melting metal if you stack it with your amp gain or another pedal.
It just sounds good - I was looking for high gain and I found it, lots of thick, bassy chug, even with the low-output P90s on my guitar.

Cons:
The construction is cheap - The case feels thin and I don't like that the switch doesn't feel like it goes down all the way unless I really step on it. This could just be on mine, but it is noticeable.
It's NOISY - Good god, this picks up everything if you're not careful. If you go any further than 12 o'clock on the gain dial, there is a lot of background hiss and buzz.

But overall, the sound quality and price far outweigh the cons.",4.0

"Initially I was a bit disappointed with this rainstick; the cactus is not very attractive. It looks very much like an old piece of wood that has been allowed to lay out in the weather for an extended time. Depending on how it affects the sound, I may try braiding a leather lacing around it to give it a more interesting appearance. After playing with the rainstick for a few minutes I became more and more pleased with the purchase. I like the sound variations you can produce with it.

The rainstick I received does not have a frayed string around the middle as shown in the picture; it has a woven band near one end that is far more attractive, being colorful without being gaudy.

The rainstick seems a bit over priced, but I'm giving it four stars because I like the sounds you can make with it.",4.0

"I was expecting this product to be just like apple's garage band.  it defently isnt.

when you record into the program with an intrument(i use my guitar and microphone) it imports into the program a little off. let me clarify: i could record a guitar part. then a bass part.  when i play it back, they don't line up perfectly.

another flaw is when you are recording you can use a metronome to hit on beats two and four. when i record a secound part, the metronme with hit on the and of one and the and of three. that really throws me off.

this program does have some good!

unlike garage band, the loops are stored on seperate disks that you upload in stead of the content taking up hardrive space.

so this really is a good a product you just have to get around the problems.  if you know what your doing when it comes to computers then get this product. you will be able to get the best of this product(it has a great ptential)  if your not the best a computers then you might want a program that is a little easier to use.",4.0

"the reviews for this cello were so mixed, I was afraid to buy it. but, the price difference between buying this one and buying one at my local shop was so extreme that I figured I'd try this one out. it arrived quickly, in one piece. the bridge was secured onto the instrument with no problem. the hard case is fantastic. the whole cello and case are very light. that was good for us as we were taking it with us overseas. I put the whole case with the cello inside into a big duffel bag and since it didn't weigh very much, I was able to stick a whole bunch of other stuff around the cello case to make the duffel bag weigh 50 pounds. the cello looks very nice, well varnished and a pretty color (totally irrelevant, I know, I'm just describing it.) the sound is very nice. my daughter is 10 and this is her 3rd year studying the cello. she is pretty petite but I think she'll be able to use this cello for the next 3 years or so. all the accessories are useful- the stand, the extra strings, the bow. overall an amazing deal.

"Excellent little tool for the classical guitarist: the four surfaces help produce a glass-smooth nail edge. Designed specifically for guitarists, clearly. Not really meant for rough shaping -- use a quality file for that, but for finishing and polish, excellent. Only gets 4 stars because it doesn't last terribly long, but it's inexpensive enough, and much easier to carry than files and multiple pieces of fine-grit paper. I keep one in my guitar's case, and one in my purse for touch-ups. Highly recommend.",4.0
Had a bunch of back row pedals on my pedalboard that I could not get to because of the height of the pedals in front of them.  The real problem was  a tap-tempo pedal that was on my back row.

"So I got mine off of mandolin cafe. Love it, has good tone, inlets are beautiful, electronics come out clear though you have no control over tone or volume from the instrument (meaning you have to control it from your amp or audio interface). I enjoyed the finish and the the overall style, it isn't heavy at all and is just comfortable. Be careful if you ever have to remove the bridge, their is a wire that is connected to the inside of the bridge so removing it can break the wire and rid you of your use of the electronics.",5.0

"Used to replace the drivers in some old JBL bookshelf speakers. Speakers fit well.  During install, noticed the mounting holes were partially covered with rubber surround from woofer.  Screws caused rubber to buckle which over time caused rubber and foam surround to separate from metal basket.  Dismounted speakers, used an awl to create holes through rubber driver material over mounting holes. Applied gorilla glue to reseal rubber to basket and more glue to reseal foam surround to rubber.  After cure time, speakers tested fine.  At least good enough for me.  Had I created the holes in the rubber during initial install I probably would not have had any problems.  For the price, I would definitely recommend these speakers for non-audiophile applications.  Only three star rating for loose manufacturing tolerances.  Price to performance makes these closer to a four star rating, though.",3.0

"These seemed promising, and at the very least I thought they'd act as plain-old earplugs.  Wrong.  My wife and I each wore a pair to three concerts - Bruno Mars, Weird Al Yankovich & John Mellencamp.  Numerous times, in each concert, the pitches were actually distorted to the point that certain instruments seemed out of tune.  As a point of reference, my wife and I are musicians (3 music degrees between us), so I'm writing with at least a little authority on the matter.  A few times I removed the earplugs to get the true tonality, only to discover they were causing the problem.

In addition, following EACH of the concerts, our hearing had been diminished.  So, they don't even act as traditional earplugs would.  The music seemed really bass-heavy with them in.

What's more, one of them fell apart in my pocket before Mellencamp.

For years I'd just used normal foam earplugs for concerts.  Looks like I will again.",2.0

"The pictures do not do this item justice.  This is a beauty in materials, craftsmanship, and finish.  The sunburst design really shows off the wood grain before fading to the black edges. The sides and neck are of a rich reddish wood grain finish (mahogany). The edges are meticulously finished in white trim and looks more expensive than it is priced.  The sound is awesome and once dialed in and tuned, gives off a rich, vibrant tone. The packaging was double boxed and had plenty of padding.  It took a while to ship to me, but worth the wait.  The only regret is that I did not order a guitar stand when I bought this. It is too nice to merely prop up against the wall on the carpet.  By the way, this guitar is a joy to play and makes you want to play it whenever you see it. Before people had video games, people enjoyed musical instruments for entertainment (still do), and this is the equivalent of getting an XBox 360.",5.0
"I tried to put these on last week, as soon as I put some tension on them trying to get them in tune, the low E strings wraps seperated and the string came out of my FR bridge. So I cut it, inserted it again, tightened it down with ease, thinking maybe I went to tight the first time. Same result, the wraps on the string seperated again. So I then pull the string out, and reverse it by cutting off the ball, I then insert the heavily wound end that was next to the ball and it works finally. They have a good tone to them, but I think the Stainless Steel are better. Anyway, fast forward to a week later. I'm setting at my computer playing some new stuff I had written, and I hear a pop, and everything is out of tune. The A string seperated and popped out of its position in my FR. Now I know everyone is going to say I need to replace the knifes in my FR, but I bought this guitar new 6 months ago, and have never had this problem until this set of strings. Whats worse, is I was going to flip the A string around like I did the E, but as I unwrapped it from the tuning key, it broke, which could be typical for any string I suppose. These things seem so brittle its not funny. Maybe I got a bad set, maybe you shouldn't use them on FR bridges, who knows. I know I'll go back to the stainless. I love Ernie Ball strings, but things were awful.",1.0

"The pick guard is mirrored plastic as opposed to chrome as the title would have you believe.
The guitar overall quality is what you'd expect from a cheaper version of a Fender made overseas, but I paid extra for this thing because the title specifically says ""Black and Chrome"" and I figured I was getting the chrome pick guard I wanted instead of a cheap plastic one that I would end up replacing.  I could have bought a black squier with a white plastic pick guard for about half the price and just put on a new pick guard, but I figured I'd just buy this one with the chrome already on it.
Nothing I hate worse than flat out lying about a product.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Get the version with the white pick guard for way less money and just buy your own chrome pick guard and put it on.",1.0

"Fantastic; I believe it's a Mooer EQ branded as Fender, but it costs less and looks and sounds purrrrty!

Definitely noise-free for me and my setup... added a lot of lost bass and treble to the mix that I lost after running a long signal path due to pedalboard addiction. All of my pedals boast ""True Bypass,"" but believe me, the signal still gets cut if you're running a few there... so for me personally, I run the EQ at the end of my chain, where as others may put it right behind a muddy delay or their overdrive/distortion pedals as a harmonic EQ or boost to really get that gain going... there's no right or wrong place, though some may disagree... you figure out where it works best and what you want to use it for!

This lets my pine-cab Custom Shop Fender Bass Breaker breathe properly and brings out a lot of harmonics and dynamics to the mix that I'd thought I'd lost. Definitely a worthwhile investment and a great real-estate saver due to it's small size on your pedalboard. Dialed in my favorite sound in a few seconds and played with another couple sliders after switching guitars - going from single coils to humbuckers.

The addition of the Boost/Level knob up top which doubles as an LED is also genius, because using that in conjunction with the sliders will allow for a variety of different tones and combinations - very useful. The sliders aren't flimsy, but I wouldn't doubt you could crush them if you're slamming on this thing every day. For me; it's a 'set it and forget it' tool, that I keep on, that works in perfect harmony with my amp. I'm definitely a fan.",5.0

"Years ago, I bought the stomp box looper that was the industry leader's current model at the time. (Fire engine red, rhymes with LOSS, the model number was RC-2.) In the meantime, they've updated that model, so I can't speak about their current quality. With pre-programmed drum loops and the possibility to connect a separate ""stop"" foot-switch, you'd think that that device would have an advantage over the x2. But as I found out in five short minutes of testing the Ditto, sound quality is everything. The Ditto plays back your loop sounding exactly like the original. You may not even notice that your looper can't do that, until you feel the difference. This is huge. I'd even say my old unit made the sound of the ""live"" playing worse. With the Ditto, you find yourself playing like you would with a buddy, as opposed to a machine. It's remarkably easy to get the loops to ""fit"", because it's so intuitive, and the soft touch foot switches allow for quick and precise punching in and out. Having a dedicated stop switch makes a world of difference.  Reverse and half-speed are fun, but they don't amount to much more than fun little jokes that you'll play around with for a while before getting tired of them. One possible exception: You might consider recording a guitar loop while the x2 is in half-speed mode, then speed it up and play a bass line, slow it back down, and you'll have something that sounds almost like a real bass guitar (if your playing is precise enough). But it's more convenient and convincing to hook up an actual bass to the second input. Again: The absolute winning characteristic of this thing is the stellar sound quality. I'll give my little red toy looper to a needy nephew and loop on in CD quality. If you've got a good setup for your acoustic, that works like a charm as well, by the way. Hurray.",5.0
"This is a pretty fun toy. I actually bought it at Goodwill, and it has definitely held up to it's former's owner abuses and our own. The notes are fairly muted/dull, but they are distinct and on-key. You would get richer notes with metal - but you wouldn't want to bang around metal tubes like you can do with these. We all had fun playing them on our heads, on knees, on other tubes. We didn't use the mallets at all. My 2-year-old was thrilled, and daddy and I laughed and had a great time. They are not flexible tubes; they could leave a bruise if used roughly, but they will bend (and be damaged) before they break you. It seems a bit overpriced.",4.0

"EDIT (6/7/16): I changed my review from 5 stars to 4 stars because I realized I rated this microphone a little too high. Don't get me wrong, it sounds great. If you cannot afford jumping to something like a EV RE20 (450$), Shure SM7B (350$), Heil PR40 (330$), or EV RE320 (300$), then I would recommend this microphone to you if you have background noise problems with a normal condenser microphones.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this microphone for almost a year now, it is a great microphone with amazing sound quality. Before the Rode Procaster, I had the AT2020 USB microphone which sounded just as good, but it picked up too much background noise from my computer fans, mouse clicking, etc. I found some reviews with the Rode Podcaster, I did not want a USB mic, but then I found this and decided to buy this instead and it sounds amazing and it has very little background noise even without a noise gate.

Pros:
- Built like a Tank
- Amazing Sound Quality
- Very little background noise
Cons:
- Needs a lot of clean gain, noise floor will be very high if paired with bad preamp
- Very bassy, could easily be fixed with EQ",4.0

They're easy to apply and take off. And also easy to clean. The other thing is you can't tell that they are there. Never using any type of dampening agent again unless it's Drumdots!! Love them!! Loved them so much I ordered a second batch of them today!!,5.0
First off let me say that when you get these they do need to be run in for a good 5 or so hours that is when they really start working it also would not hurt to have a headphone amp to get the best quality I currently use the dark voice tube headphone amp which I use for vinyl,5.0

"Needed a simple headphone EQ for use in my home recording studio. I just wanted some ability to match my cans (ATH-M50) to my monitors or home bookshelf speakers while checking various aspects of my mixes and pro reference recordings. My noisy old Behringer 4700 rack-mount (headphone amp) didn't cut it, but the MiniFBQ is definitely up to the challenge. Dead quiet for basic listening and enough flexibility to shape the sound adequately. Im simply routing a Yamaha boards headphone signal (out) to the Mini (in), and the sound is excellent for my intended use.

So why not 5 stars? The first unit I received had low-level hiss that was still well beyond my tolerance level. In fact, the unit was noisier than my previous 4700 model, which I lived with but grumbled about for years. After seeing so many reviews praise the Mini's quietness, I decided to exchange mine for a second unit. Problem solved. Unfortunately, many reviews also mention reliability issues with Behringer products, and Id have to agree based on my own infrequent purchases of Behringer gear. I've learned to expect a prob. Still, if my replacement unit stays strong for a few years, Ill gladly rate it 5 stars for its great sound and smart design for basic applications. For the price of a cheap downtown dinner for two, this things unbeatable in its classas long as you can get a good one.",4.0

"I received this microphone as a givaway in a contest. The microphone itself is built well and sounds great. I really want to love this mic. Unfortunately it's riddled with reliability issues.

You must have relatively light use of 2.4 gHz radios (wifi, bluetooth, etc) to get any sort of reliability with the mic. I have a couple of wireless routers, bluetooth, and wireless DMX in our building. I'd consider this pretty standard of a live production environment. However, even with this, we get intermittent drops in signal. I've spoke with Sennheiser and their only suggestion was to relocate or remove other 2.4 gHz devices from the premises completely.

The antenna is ultra sensitive to touch and likely to cause drops as well. The antenna is located at the bottom of the mic. If you touch it or cover it, the signal will be dropped. In theory, you just show the talent how to hold the mic and you're good to go. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. People forget when they're on stage, or hand the mic off to someone unexpected, and then your mic is dropping in and out like crazy.

Finally, a few minor complaints:

Their update scheme is lacking. Their documentation all refers to iOS and Android apps. It took at least 6 months from release date to actually have an iOS app available. To my knowledge, there's still no android app. The only way to update the firmware is through said app.

The mic grill itself seems to be flaking off too, after just about a year of use.

With all of these complaints, I'm still giving them an 3-star rating, because the quality and features of the mic and superb. The auto gain control and the ability to remotely change settings on the mic from the receiver box is great.

Final thought, if you have a venue that has low 2.4 gHz usage, get this mic. Otherwise, a more traditional wireless mic may be a better bet.",3.0

"Received this second tier stand on time and in the original unopened box with the tier wraped in plastic.  The tier attaches to the cross braced stand by removing the end caps and inserting the adjustiable metal lugs into the 1 inch tubing. Adjust the horizontal tier brace and tighten the lugs securely.  Adust the tilt angle you want, place your keyboard on the arms of the tier and go for it!  It is portable, but you must remove the tier stand completely from the cross brace stand.  After a few times of setting up, it is not much of a hassel.  Only three stars because the tier's horizontal brace is just not long enough for me and is easily separated while getting the riser arms to verticle and square.  The thumb screw used to secure the tier's horizontal brace is easily lost.  Replace the thumb screw with metric 6mm hex bolt and keep a few on hand because you will lose these during travel.  This tier stand is just that and does the job of adding another keyboard (maybe not a full 88 keys) above the primary board.  The second tier stand is a good addition to have when you want to add a smaller synth or controller to your rig.",3.0

"I think I first saw/heard this mic in the original Concert for Bangladesh, and could not get over how cool it looked.  Typically, I wouldn't consider buying such a thing based on appearance consideration, but the fact that George Harrison and Leon Russell felt them worthy, I considered it a safe purchase.  To say the least, I was amazed by this mic.  As a producer, I've used it for everything from vocals to horns to acoustic guitar - even capturing  cymbal nuances that were lost on other more expensive mics.  Live or in the studio, this mic is a serious performer that no performer or studio should be without - several, if budget allows.  You won't run out of uses for it.  The one down-side is that, over time, the frequency response goes dead (like any mic), but this can be factory-refurbished back to original specs.  The mic comes with a graph read-out of your mic's unique response characteristics.",4.0

"Honestly, I was expecting something better than the reviews suggested. The pads are not as sensitive as I would like them to be (I have to hit them pretty hard to get any velocity out of them), and the keys felt like I was using a toy piano for little kids instead of a real musical instrument, but that was probably to be expected. The software that it came with is superb, however. Would reccomend as a gift to an aspiring young music maker; but, not for anything professional, though.",3.0
"I used this product to replace the stock pins that came with my Fender CD140SCE.  The cheap, plastic stock pins that came with the guitar were damaged from routine string changes to the extent that it was difficult to pull them out of the bridge.  These pins are a beautiful ebony wood with a subtle pearlescent inlay and are slightly larger than the stock pins, giving them a prominent look on the bridge. Given that they have a lip, I imagine they will be easier to pull in the future as well.  Very happy with these pins, wish I had bought them years ago.",5.0
"I first started looking for a new ligature because I needed one that firmly holds the reed in place. My particular needs also require a metal ligature to avoid an airy tone. This ligature holds the reed in place far better than I ever expected. It is impossible to move the reed once the ligature is tightened, which is great. I am also able to achieve a clear tone without airiness. Mouthpiece response is also improved compared to stock ligatures. Lower notes seem to speak with more ease with the Platinum. Intonation is improved compared to the stock ligatures that flatten pitch. Part of the design of the Platinum is to be dark, therefore, there is not a great amount of flexibility or brilliance.  However, there is a slight ring and weight added to the sound. Single screw operation is also more precise than double screw. I'd recommend this ligature for anyone looking for the previously stated improvements. The Platinum compliments my long shank Selmer Soloist F facing  with Vandoren V16 #2 reeds",4.0

"Wow. For many years I have been looking for a pedal exactly like this one. Now that it is finally out, here are some first impressions...

It's nice to know they really did think of everything with this pedal. There are over 200 different songs to play with, and you are able to play around with ten different drum sets. The samples are 'non-quantized,' so it really does sound like real drums.

If you own any drum software such as Steven Slate drums, Addictive Drums, etc., then you can easily create beats on those programs, then put them on the beat buddy, which stores its memory on an SD card. So, in reality, the amount of beats you can play on this pedal are endless.

My favorite feature is MIDI sync. I have four pedals that are able to be clocked to a midi sync (Strymon big 3, pigtronix infinity looper). The pedal allows my effects to stay perfectly in time with the beat. Having my delay trails perfectly timed with a nice beat will never stop putting a smile on my face. And looper fans!...This will allow any midi-capable looper to sync perfectly with the drum beat. No more robot-perfect timing needed to keep your loop in time.

As far as performance, this thing is a blast to play with. Having control of transitions, fills, cymbal crashes, chorus, etc. is really an incredible tool when writing your own songs and especially playing live. And, it's so damn fun. It really is so much more gratifying playing my guitar and bass, knowing that I'll have an amazing sounding drummer that is always on time to practice with. It is a bit pricey, but I must say, totally worth it.",5.0

"I like the idea of these.  Especially when you don't have to have a full sound coming out. AKA: tuning in private.  The 2 pack is great and I can put them on guitars and always have them on there.  The tuning factor is a little iffy.  They do tune accurately but I've found that if other things are going on around it, they have problems recognizing the vibrations from the guitar they're on and not the bass players amp and/or drummer/percussionist warming up.  Not sure how to correct this except to have them both stop while I tune.  Having them stop is annoying because a regular corded tuner can be used with all the noise in the world and get accurate readings.

"This is an excellent guitar.  It is well made and has a beautiful bright sound and once I pick it up, I hate to put it down.

Right now I have narrowed my best guitars down to the Yamaha FG830, theTaylor 214e Deluxe Natural, the Blue ridge BR141a, and the Martin DSR2 and in that order.  On the cut aways The Washburn WCG66SCE with the Cedar Top and Spalted Maple back, and sides is the most beautiful and best sounding cut away of all of my guitars.  It plays almost, as good as the non cutaways.  Sometimes when I pick it up and think it's best.  That is how good it is!  None of the other cutaways, unplugged, sounds this good, period.

The little handle on the main stem that is  flipped up or down to adjust the height of the stand  is not as convenient to use if you were holding an instrument in your hand.

Once you release at the part of the stand that holds the music may come down hard on your fingers as it did mine the first time. Ouch!

Cheap craftsmanship/plastic for sure. For some reviews that claimed that this metranome could withstand years of wear and tear they're completely wrong. There are much better ones like this model that won't break on you without the plastic cracking from a mere tumble on a stage floor. Ridiculous on so many levels.

It is almost impossible to get the bow to skip over any string. It is now much easier to play very quick runs. The 2nd thing I noticed is they are much louder than my old set. The third thing I noticed is they can play incredibly soft. Now I can play the super soft parts with just a few hairs of the bow touching the string without sacrificing quality.

Luckily, the show was unaffected, but I have no use for musical gear that can't be relied upon. Once at home, I reinstalled the drivers, tried a different computer, different ports, and even tried different firewire cables. Still not working. Garbage. In the future, I'm sticking with pricier, but more reliable gear.",1.0

"When you first pull the guitar out of the box and grasp it, the weight and finish suggest high-quality materials. Then you plug it into the amp and start trying to play it, and that's when you realize the manufacturer skimped on component quality. First the ""volume"" knob pops off the guitar face, then the amp won't actually play until you figure out the trick that you need to pull the amp input plug about a third of the way out of the guitar to establish a connection, then the little hex screws at the base of the strings start popping out as the guitar is strummed (we are very lucky to have not yet lost any of those screws...YET; no matter how much we screw them back down, a couple of them insist on popping back out), then the amp plug starts to fray at the base and the copper wiring becomes exposed (on Day 2!).

I gave this two stars instead of one because of the aforementioned main body quality, and because the kids actually have fun with it for a while before I have to step in to again fix the plug and hex screws. But it's really 1 1/2 stars, if you wanna get technical.",2.0

"It certainly powers your pedals and looks cool while doing it (blue LED's light up your board), but it isn't isolated. Competitors (a la Voodoo Power Supplies) do a great job at cutting out the noise from pedals. Unless you're only running a few pedals, this does not. This makes it somewhat useless for live settings and entirely useless for recording.

I was in a rush to get a power supply and didn't have the extra money to doll out for the Voodoo Power Supply so I went with this. Unfortunately, I already put Velcro on the supply (my fault) and cannot return it, but definitely wish I went the battery route and saved up for another Voodoo Power Supply.",2.0

I dinged them a star for sending the wrong color, but if color doesn't matter to you, this IS a quality plastic product, NOT cheaply made! After reading another review from 2014, I was dubious about ordering it, and was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty heavy-duty.  Color was my issue.",4.0
"I've been using Quickbooks ever since there was a Quickbooks (think DOS version). I was amazed at how QB actually did what they said they would do. Simple, effective accounting that worked. Good stuff.

Not anymore. I have just upgraded (downgraded) to QB for Mac 2015. I'd be better off with a shoebox and some receipts. Please note I have the latest of everything (new Mac hardware, latest OS, latest version of QB) and it's never not broken for some reason. BTW, this MacMini is dedicated to one application: Quickbooks.

Icons have changed, screen locations have changed, presets have disappeared, company files won't open (meaning nothing works) and backups won't install, and more. This is standard operating procedure. Then you get to opportunity to call Support and be charged for doing Intuit's field testing for them.

I'm looking for an alternative solution.

UPDATE: The current problem involves the license number and product number simply disappearing when I close the application. The application doesn't work in that case. At all. Each time I reopen I have to ""deactivate this computer"" and then RE-register the computer by adding the license number and product number as though I were a new customer. Except now that doesn't work any more. Remember, this is a single user system, running on a new MacMini, with a current and up to date operating system and application software. My accounting system is dead in the water. Again.",1.0

"This is a fantastic strap. As a beginning banjo player, I originally bought a leather strap with the metal clips at each end to attach the banjo. Immediately I wasn't happy with that one as I felt the clips were potentially scratching the surface of my banjo, and the leather was too stiff and not overly comfortable.
I found this strap, ordered one, and absolutely love it. The web loop type connections are excellent, and appear to be made well and sewn onto the quick release brackets very well. Never been worried about it not supporting the weight of my banjo (about 10lbs). The strap itself is very comfortable for wearing for long periods of time, and has a slight ""stretch"" that feels comfortable on the shoulder and also allows for easy adjustment.
Highly recommended strap!",5.0
"For the cost this is a good microphone.  No it is certainly not a Shure big buck microphone, but for the money it gets the job done.  If you are limited to voice, it should get the job done but I'm not sure I would recommend it for music.  I don't believe it is going to have the dynamic range needed for that.  I will say that my testing shows that there was little difference between plugging it in directly to a PC and using a phantom power injector.  I got a little more volume out of it with phantom power but only a small amount.  Overall, I am please for the cost and included accessories.  Decent construction and feel and sufficiently meets my needs.",4.0

"Just purchased this for an acoustic guitar amplifier. It makes a strong clear sound and has some valuable features I did not expect to get. It can be used with a powered subwoofer, and the connection activates a high pass filter for the PW100T. It also has phantom power on two microphone jacks. These units are linkable via XLR input/output jacks. Because of the narrow profile and light weight, I found this to be an amazing buy. A user needing to service a large room would need multiple units. Volume is consistent with the 100 watt rating.
Edit: After using it I realize that it is rather bright in tone. This might be a negative for some, a positive though for my vocal needs.",5.0

It's a small form factor, lights up so you know if it's muting or not, and mutes without any clicking noises carrying over to the amp.",5.0

"This was the humidifer that the music store salesman recommended when I purchased my guitar. I now have two guitars and two dampits for several years. They work well but dry out after about 3 days with guitar in its case. They must be completedly wringed out before use to avoid drips inside the guitar. I will be switching to a gel system that lasts longer so that there will be no concern when I am away on long vacations.
P.S. The included humidity ""meter"" is worthless. Has not changed reading in 5 years.

Update 2017:
This is not your father's Dampit. Much skinnier and missing the metal clip on end. Can no longer clip it to strings to store in case in vertical or on its side position for case. Instructions say just throw it inside of guitar, will not affect sound. Don't feel comfortable about doing that.",2.0

"In contrast to the reviewer that gives this two stars (works for the competition possibly?), I love this thing.  I have an old (RCA with a little converter box that goes from the RCA plug to the red/yellow/white plugs) tv and don't want to buy an LCD/Plasma yet, and this thing lets me watch all my digital media on my tv.

The body is light-weight, compact and space-efficient.  It is large enough to hold the necessary components and hookups.  No wasted space at all = bonus.  5/5

It's plastic and light weight.  Like every other consumer product in the universe.  No biggie. And I wouldn't want this unit to be made of anything heavy which would only make it cumbersome. 5/5

There are no face buttons or controls on the unit itself, but see the point above. I looked at most other players under $100, and none of them had face buttons.  All controls are on the remote, so yes, if you lose it you do have to call the company and get another.  So...don't lose it!  ;)  That said, the remote is very easy to use, buttons have icons on them.  The downside of the remote is that all the buttons are uniform so it is a little difficult to use in the dark. No different than every other remote I own.  4/5

I had absolutely no problem with video set up.  I plugged everything in, glanced at the directions in the manual, pushed the stand-by button, and lo and behold there was the menu with all my folders!  I pushed the menu button and there was the menu for video, audio and picture size.  Simply push the > button to move through options and the enter button to set preferences.  I did not have to struggle blindly with anything, and I figured all this out without reading the manual.  Very intuitive.  I was watching Venture Brothers within 4 minutes of taking the unit out of the box. 5/5

I can't comment on the usefulness any of the plugs except the red/yellow/white ones, the RCA plugs.  Everything is color-coded, and the USB and HDMI are clearly labeled.  The cables are of the same quality of all cables I've every received with any electronic devise I've ever bought: thick coating, good useful length.  No problem there.  5/5

It does not support mp4, as described in the product's own description.  So if you only want to watch mp4, don't get this.  If you have media in most every other format that you want to watch with one machine, buy this and take a few minutes to convert your mp4s.  I've watched AVI, IFO, WMP, MPG, FLV and listened to my mp3s.  5/5

"The package arrived on time and was about as I had expected reading other interviews.  The case of the Vox AC30 is cheaply formed, which is a shame considering that this device is convenient for just playing around with headphones. It would not take much additional cost by Vox to beef up the case construction and the controls, which they would pass on to the consumers, but two or three dollars would go very far in high-impact plastic and some better quality pots (controls).  The sound is okay, and I am good with it since this device is for me to play around with a few licks on a lazy afternoon on the back porch, or some place I cannot access my systems and don't want to drag even a small amp around (which will have only marginal sound anyway).",3.0

"Vinyl still has its mystique. There are those who will argue that it still sounds better than CD's. I have to agree; it has the potential to sound better. There are a lot of factors that can affect how great your records sound, and a great turntable, equipped with a Stanton 500 cartridge, you can expect some fine sound from your LP's and yes, even your 45's. Can it be made better? Yes, by switching the stylus out with an elliptical replacement stylus.

The Stanton 500 cartridge, as most people have used it, comes with a .7 mil conical stylus. That's fine, but it doesn't contact as much of the groove wall as it could. The elliptical stylus, with a .3 x .7 mil stylus, is able to contact parts of the groove wall that were untouched by the conical, thus breathing new life into the sound of that record. The Stanton D5100E stylus, the original Stanton replacement, is no longer available. The stylus in question is made in Switzerland by Pfanstihl, a company that manufacturers replacement styli for a wide variety of magnetic cartridges, and it's every bit as good, if not even better, than the original Stanton. If you have a Stanton 500C or 500AL, this is an upgrade. The difference in sound is very obvious. The Stanton 500 is the industry standard for DJ's, but it's also great for your normal listening, too. Upgrade the stylus and you'll be very happy with the results.",5.0

"The piano is fantastic - the keys are realistic in touch and tactility and the sound is great. The lower tones get a little overbearing sometimes but at other times the piano doesn't sound loud enough, a product of my acoustics, I'd guess. There are more features than I need, and I do not recommend the ""learning"" features as real pianists don't learn by pressing any note to hear the melody, or allowing the piano to create the rest of the song while they slog thru hunting and pecking. The recording I can't seem to get with a metronome - a little indicator light flashes in time to what a metronome SHOULD be tapping out, but I read my music, don't look at indicator lights. But I sat down the first afternoon and sight-read a choir octavo and recorded SAT with piano accompaniment, in about 2 hours, including reading the manual to figure out how. Got a decent demo product for the choir to listen to out of that time. That feature alone will save me tons of time multi-tracking or entering notes manually in software to output a practice MP3 for them.

This takes up less space than we anticipated and it looks like a real piece of furniture, not a toy keyboard. The bench, while a little narrow, is easy to put together and comfortable. The whole unit is pretty easy to assemble, actually, as I did most of it myself in about 15 minutes - then my husband helped me with the last few steps.

Shipping was not the best. Starck Van Lines delivered this, and not only were they over a week late in shipping, but I couldn't select my date out of two that they would be in the area. They offered what they call a ""half hour out"" call but they didn't call. So we came home from work to find a piano sitting on the deck for who-knows-how-long. Good thing no one stole it and the weather was mild that day. They called the next day and said their driver did not fill out the paperwork properly, did we actually receive the piano?!?!?",5.0

"This synth is loaded with a lot of great sounds - and it is very programmable. You can program your own beats, phrases, arpeggios and sounds. Layers, splits, assignable sliders. It can do a lot. In fact, for me personally, that's the only problem - it can do more than I can absorb. I know I'm not using it anywhere near it's capabilities. In researching this keyboard I found that most keyboard magazine and equipment reviews gave it high marks on sounds and programing, so I'm figuring that the difficulty lies with me and not the Micron. There will definitely be a learning curve if you're new to programming. The sounds and beats are very useable and inspiring, so overall I'm quite satisfied and happy with the keyboard.",4.0

It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food, musicians, movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.

"Ordered two more after the first two came in.  Relatively easy to install, and I'm not worried about my guitars falling out.

Nevertheless, I might put some sort of cushion on the wall to make it a quicker process to put the guitar in without having to worry about banging it against the wall.",5.0

"The description says ""for the 5A player who wants a bit more power and reach"". This is absolutely the best way to describe it. I always tend to use heavier sticks because I like getting that extra half-inch reach. But in practice settings, 5Bs or ""rock"" sticks are just a bit too much for me. Plus I've always preferred the lighter sticks. Granted, stick size is all about personal preference. So as far as quality goes, these things hold up! The sticks are well matched, nice quality, and resistant to breaking. I have yet to break one of these sticks lengthwise (I always wear out the tips and taper before the stick ever breaks). I will continue to use these sticks for a long time to come! Highly recommend.",5.0

"Although I may be a phony at the mic, this mic is no phony. The Samson G Track Microphone exceeded my expectations, for the price. I've only used this mic to record voice but have mixed that in with music. I am very impressed with the quality of this product and how my voice sounds against the professionally recorded music tracks. This microphone also has the look and feel (mostly weight) of a quality product not to mention it looks impressive sitting on the desk of my make shift recording studio (home office). A relative of mine has done ""professional"" voice recordings, and my untrained ear cannot tell the difference between them speaking on my mic vs. the playback of their ""professional"" recordings. The knobs feel very solid and velvety smooth to use. The stand, which it comes with, is solid metal and firmly plants itself on any flat surface. I have a desktop computer that I use this with and it's inside the desk that has the microphone on it. After reading some reviews I was concerned that I might pick up too much noise from that or something else, but no problems. I quickly found a nice balance of mic gain vs. speaking distance from the mic.

I gave this product a 4 star rating because it has surpassed every expectation that I had of it, however, there is a problem with this product. The problem is the software that comes with it. I received Cakewalk's Sonar 6 LE software to edit and mix the tracks I recorded with my microphone. The whole package comes ready to use right out of the box, except for the all the time it takes to figure out how to use the software - very frustrating. That being said I quickly gave up on it and downloaded the AVS recording/editing/mixing software and it works great. The good news for me was I had already purchased some AVS software and that was included with it but in a separate download. To purchase it runs around $40 dollars, but I purchased the lifetime registration that allows me to download all of their software, unlimitedly, for as long as they are in business, which is about $60. I tried the Audacity software, but it kept locking up on my computer after about 30 seconds of recording. I do have Windows Vista 64, so that may be the issue.

To be fair to Cakewalk, their software isn't junk, it just needs to be made more user friendly. When using this software I get the impression that it was designed for someone who actually has experience working a real soundboard, understands the terminology, and is familiar with producing music. The problem as I see it is that the software seems to be several experience levels above what it takes to sufficiently record/edit/mix with the microphone. Maybe I'm wrong but I'm not in the music business and I wanted something better than a webcam mic and this seemed like the perfect product; and it was except the software is geared to a more professional type. I will say that after having some time to play around with the Cakewalk software, that it works well and has almost an unlimited number features (at least it seems to be) I have been able to mix a few tracks but still leave my recording and editing to the AVS software, because it's just too easy. Then I simply import the tracks into the Cakewalk software and start mixing. Another issue I had with the software was the inability to actually use the recorded file after I mixed it in Cakewalk. Again I had to turn to the AVS software for an audio converter to go from .WAV type sound file to .MP3 type sound file. I found out later that Cakewalk will sell you an encoder to do this for almost $20, but again the AVS software does it for me.

For best recording you will need to invest in a ""pop"" filter for your mic. This eliminates all the popping sounds made by your lips when you pronounce -P's, B's and etc. Do not pay more than $10 for one of these. This is something that is not that technical or benefits by exotic materials or fancy features.

I would not hesitate to buy this item again or recommend it to anyone.",4.0

"The Seller shipped very fast and I give them 5 plus stars; this review is regarding the actual product.
The Behring US600 is a basic pitch shifter, don't expect elaborate effects.
Made of plastic; not as sturdy as a BOSS pedal.
Goes through 9V batteries quickly, so stock up.
If you use an A/C adapter, get a hum eliminator.
(Curse you 60 cycle!)
Also run the US600 AFTER the distortion for optimum performance.
Other wise you are shifting the clean signal.
Distortion, pitch shifter, chorus, then out.
This pedal gives you a sweet 12-string chorus sound and that alone is worth the 45 bones. The dive bombs, reverse dive bombs, and flutter are there. Don't expect a 2 octave bottom, because it doesn't do that.
You will not sound like a Thin Lizzy dual guitar lead, but you can get that Bryan May, Queensryche meets the Allman Brothers harmonies in 3rds.
For those on a budget, this pedal does what it doesn't advertise.

In comparison to Neumann U87 ($3,600) this mic sounds (almost / exactly) identical for 1/12th the price.

If I remember correctly the main difference being there is no switchable polar/pick-up pattern on this mic, but at its default pick-up and in comparison to the Neumann U87 there really is no difference - except for the price!

$300 vs. $3,600

You decide!

"The design looks good, it has good quality and solid/strong built, the problem is that it is very heavy, the tray is actually heavier than what I was planning to use it for. if you use it in a microphone stand it is so heavy that it might cause the stand to tilt over. it would be good if it was made of a lighter metal. The design of the clamp is nice looking, but not very useful. I have a mixer stand and needed to use this tray to put a couple of little things on it under my mixer. The clamp doesn't fit on the mixer stand, so I cannot use it the way I was planning to. The clamp only fits in those cheap skinny microphone stands, or on the skinny extension portion of a standard microphone stand, it won't fit on a sheet music stand, so the clamp makes the use of this tray very limited, and the screw that is used to tighten the clamp is not protected so it will scratch and leave a mark on whatever stand you use attach it to.",2.0
These feel cheap because they are made of plastic but they worked really well for a Gala I just worked. I put the lav on a podium while the speakers presented and stood in the back of the room and it picked it up great.

"First of all... As we all know for whatever reason Fender does not have the greatest of reputations when it comes to acoustic guitars.  That may be true for some, but not all.  Secondly, one either loves or hates the ""Strat"" headstock of the California Series.  I happen to be in the camp of the ""love it"".  I believe (like most) guitars built in China, consistency in quality can be spotty... And Fender certainly fits that category.  Having said that, I was one of the lucky ones receiving a Sonoran that was done right.  Set up nicely right out of the box.  And... it looks very cool.  But most of all, it sounds really nice.  Deep full sound that can also be bright when desired.  I'll admit, I get wrapped up in the history and the California vibe of the Sonoran series.  Perhaps not to the point where I would purchase one in Surf Green, bet hey... to each their own.  Although, if I had a little money to throw around... I would also have a Surf Green model just for show!  Anyway... In my humble opinion, and my years of experience I feel the Sonoran is a great value.  If you like the looks... go for it!  Oh and one more thing... If you do go for it, you'll need a case.  I looked everywhere for recommendations and was very hard to find.  The best (and most reasonably priced) case for this guitar is ""Musicians Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case.  Fits perfect and is a solid case... That won't break the bank.",5.0

"trash..... lighting was properly addressed so my DMX controller could control them however lights would not respond to any DMX command. other lights further down the DMX chain flickered on and off and received their DMX commands erratically. I purchased two of these and both are malfunctioning in the same way, master slave does work and sound active does work. if you don't need DMX they are not to bad, if you need DMX look elsewhere.

DMX FIX: the issue with the dmx being non responsive is a reverse polarity condition inside the light. To fix remove some from the fixture, locate the dmx PCB board (has the dmx in and out soldered to it), unplug the wire from the pcb noting which way it was plugged in, use a small flathead to gently slide off the plastic port on the pcb and discard leaving only the pins, reconnect the wire to the bare pins the opposite way it came off. If your lucky your fixture will now work correctly. Also note that this light does not self terminate the dmx chain, if this light is on the end of the run and is not responding correctly plug a dmx terminator into the out port and it should clear up.",3.0
"I have used the Carbon 49 for 3 months and I'm pretty well satisfied. It feels better than the price would indicate. I was wary of the keyboard at first, but for my playing, it handles trills well, which is the acid test. Its NOT a first-choice pro item that handles multiple zones and has a bigger display; a Novation controller would be better and worth the added cost.
 However, I have reached a point where I use software synths a lot and its been great running Logic. If I need pressure sensing, I have 2 workstations for that, but its helped my work flow to be able to just turn and play without firing up the whole rig. Its stable under USB, the build is surprisingly solid for a little guy like this and if you mainly need a keyboard rather than a piece sporting assignable knobs, sliders and pads, it gives good yeoman service. I securely taped the USB cable in a small loop on the back to assure strain relief for the plug and its been solid.
 Yes, its a budget item, but I've sold synths as a salesman and played for years, so I have a more objective view than some. This is not a good choice for road work, but as a home controller or an emergency back-up, its worthy. It seems as though its oddly a better item than its bigger brother, the Graphite. Its a no-go for solo piano, but if you are a newbie or more of a synthesizer-minded type, its far better than anything else for the price and a few that cost even more. The feel is a subjective matter, admittedly, but don't dismiss it casually. If Samson would toughen up the builds on this and the Graphite by about 20% with v. 2, they'd be rockin'. I gave it 4 points because it has a few limitations like a spartan GUI, but by Crom, the little guy is a quiet cousin who has unexpectedly done the family proud.",4.0
"Provided enough light to completely illuminate two pages, but couldn't light up more than that.  Would consider getting a 2nd light except for the following statement. Unfortunately, it doesn't really fit in the little bag and the ""on"" switch must've gotten pressed while in my gig bag so the 2nd time I tried to use it, the battery was gone.  Guess I need to be more careful and carry extra batteries.

Edited to add:  Kudos to the reviewer who suggested removing batteries while keeping light in gig bag - great idea which should solve my problem!

"Decent guitar. Dont let the photo fool you, the finish is better than whats in the picture. Its a darker red and had beautiful flame to it. With that said, i returned mine. The first and most important thing was the pickups. I have only owned one other guitar with emg's in my 30 years of playing, and i sold that guitar . I purchased this because i thought it would be nice to have a guitar for just playing metal. Although it does great for that, EMG's sound just doesn't do it for me. Way too hot and almost muddy with ice pick highs. The only good metal sound i have heard with EMG 81's was Kerry kings BC rich all maple V through his signature head. That was an amazing sound. Crunchy , bright, lively . But, if you are death metal, this guitar will be great. I also like Steve Swansonwith six feet under, youll get that sound with this guitar. Its just not my thing for playing.

Another minor annoyance was the guitars truss rod was at full tight ( probably for shipping ) and that caused a few frets to buzz a little. Not a big deal , its an easy fix i can do ( i didn't do it being that im not keeping it ) but i didn't like that fact. Also, i liked the size of the frets. They are big but not huge like 6100's so they are comfortable , BUT the fret edges weren't so great. Wont hurt your hand , but you can feel them. My cheap squire classic vibe 60's strat has a better fret job and its a $375 guitar.

All in all its a good buy. If you like EMG 81's and want a great looking guitar at a great price its worth it. You might have to get it set up if you don't know how to do truss rod adjustments and you may get the fret edges touched up.

Also, Amazons shipping is great and FAST ! They have nothing to do with the packing .But ESP NEEDS to put a layer of thin foam between the strings and neck. The strings had some rough spots in them from being pushed against the frets. Could have been worse and damaged the frets. Sometimes boxes get stacked and it could cause fret damage.

ESP is still a great guitar maker , and Amazon is excellent !",3.0

(My track record with other stringed instruments isn't great.) As it turns out, I LOVE ukulele. Within a few days, I was able to plunk out a few chords & play a song. The stock stings won't stay tuned for a few days. While this is normal for all new strings, I replaced them & the sound quality was much improved. I play it nearly everyday.

The quality is the only reason I'm docking a star. In the 3 months I've had it I've noticed that the bridge isn't flush with the body, although it seems to be holding the strings constant. Also, there's a tiny crack in the paint on the back where it appears that the neck is separating from the body. It just doesn't have a well-made feel to it.
Nice uke regardless.",4.0

"A little skeptical at first on the stability of the stand, however it has performed rather well over the past month.  This stand easily resists force/movement in the vertical and forwardly horizontal direction, which is very important.  In a transverse (side-to-side) direction the stand moves quit freely, although this is irrelevant because the force applied by your fingertips in that direction are generally negligible (I purposely applied transverse force to check for movement).  More relevant if there are to be kids running wildly bumping into the side of it.

I apologize for the technical explanation but I felt it was lacking in the comments.  Overall, this stand is sturdy/stable in the relevant directions, lightweight, low profile, and very affordable.  Would recommend for virtually anyone.",5.0

"I use this cab with a Marshall Haze 15 head amp while practicing and jamming with a friend.  I have a Marshall 4x12 cab and needed something that I could easily take to his house.  Overall I am very pleased with the sound quality as it yields the characteristic Marshall sound I was hoping to retain.

I was surprised and impressed at how heavy and solid this cabinet is constructed.  I regularly sit on it when practicing with friends and have no concerns (I'm a heavy guy too).  The price seems about the same as other 1x12 cabs, but I am still taking off 1 star strictly for (what I perceive) to be a high cost.",4.0
My son loved these strings.  They sound great!,5.0
Biggest and loudest speaker that can be purchased for under $100! Sounds really good with my iPhone I can't turn both up to maximum volume without distortion. But I can turn the speaker on max and my phone on 70% and it's plenty loud and sound is crisp. Battery life is great and a HUGE bonus is you can charge your mobile device with the speaker. The only thing that's missing from this speaker is a remote.,4.0

Ill say for the money these can't be beat, I tested them right away they all work great, nice clear sound, no hiss or hum, and I like the plastic storage box, keeps them safe and clean, unit comes with (3) mic holder clips, not the best quality, but I sure don't have a problem with them, I recommend these mics, for home studio use they work very well.",5.0

"I love this chinrest. It's the perfect height for me, and looks great with my violin since it's fitted with rosewood for almost everything else. However, since I do primarily orchestral playing, the chinrest tends to move and make pretty loud noises nearly every time I put my instrument down. It detracts from my playing and its making me ultimately consider a new one. So if you need to be relatively quiet when you're moving your instrument into and out of playing position, be wary.",4.0
This is definitely a great little microphone for the price. At only fifteen dollars you cannot ask for much more out of a microphone. As I was shopping around I found other condenser microphones at much higher prices and they needed an additional piece to be used but this was ready to go right out of the box and that is definitely a great plus. It gets very good quality and the tripod is very sturdy and helpful. I use this for my YouTube videos and that is definitely a great idea as I would now not want a different microphone for the price.,5.0
Perfect for my uke. So cute and sturdy.,5.0
"I bought this mic to add to the collection that we use for an open mic.  I was curious, so we did a live test, comparing it against the other mics, a collection that includes some Sonics and a couple of Shures.  It was definitely better than any of the cheaper mics, and roughly equivalent to the Shure SM 48S.  Unfortunately, we didn't have a Shure SM58 to compare it against, but I'd guess it wouldn't be quite as good.  A great mic at the price, feeling just as solid as the Shure.",4.0

"My first performing melodica was the Hammond 44, a Cadillac among these instruments, so I was spoiled. When I could no longer tune a particular note on it, I needed a performance replacement for not a lot of money, and so I gave this a try. The most important thing for me was to have a tuned instrument, and upon receipt, this was (at442, like most melodicas). Its 37-key range is not as large as the 44-key Hammond, but the F3-F6 range is as close as one can get. Like all other melodicas now since the Hammond has been discontinued, there is no pickup. I am truly missing that; I am now shopping for a pickup, because playing into a mic is not the same. I appreciated not having much trouble adjusting to the size and feel of the keys, though It does feel more like a plastic toy.  Performing with it has been a little frustrating sometimes when I am playing a line and more than an occasional note does not sound because I am blowing too hard - it happens more with this than it did with the Hammond; I am trying to accommodate my breath accordingly. The tone is brighter, not quite as warm as the Hammond; I am the only one noticing that among the folks I perform with. I have not yet tried to open this instrument to check out the innards. The spit valve is not quite at the end of the instrument; I do not seem to be eliminating as much moisture as I did with the Hammond, not sure what this is about yet. Overall, this instrument is doing the job I needed as a performing instrument, for a very reasonable price. But I am aiming to get a MyLodica next...",4.0
"My only gripe is that there's no room for my knees to really stretch out, but that's such a minor grievance that it's hardly worth noting. This item WORKS. It's sturdy. It works. It keeps my electronic keyboard up just fine.

An additional note -- my stand came with NO instruction booklet, so I had to set it up with, like, no help at all. I had no experience with that sort of thing, and I still did it in a couple of hours. If you're reading this and you also have no experience, then you'll probably do a better job than I did. That said, I set it up from scratch, no instructions, and I did it just fine, and it still works to this day. It's a great product. Definitely recommend it.",5.0
"I like that it has a large reservoir to hold the fluid, and a long trigger/power cable.  But, it feels very light and cheaply made.  If I was to drop the unit on its side, I believe the housing would crack.  The reheat time is comparable to other brands I use in the haunt.  I will say, I have paid less for smaller units that are metal and have as much output for a 400 watt.",3.0
The microphone speaks for itself... it's a Shure and the stand is equally excellent. Used it this weekend at an outdoor multiband show and it worked great. Multiple ways to address the various angles and positions needed to get the mic in place on different kick drums. The price for the package was the same as the price for the mic alone!!!

"Certainly a huge step up in protection than what you will find with gig bags (padded, rigid or otherwise). Originally I bought it for my Dean JCQM12TGE Jumbo Twelve-String Guitar, to which it was a near perfect fit. I say ""near perfect"" because my guitar is a hair taller back-to-front, so closing the lid requires a little push to seat the padding. I later found out was an actual perfect fit for my Hohner AB-40N Acoustic Bass.

You may have to do more research on other websites to get the exact internal dimensions. Fit is very important, and even though jumbo guitars have the same general shape, there can be slight differences between makes and models that would be just enough to negate using this case. It's sort of a take on the ""measure twice, cut once"" statement.

I'm not too sure how common it is for guitar cases to have an additional latch along the hinge side, which can be a little annoying if you're trying to pack or unpack in a hurry, but I can accept that considering it's giving me a more secure closure. I recommend the case, it is well balanced and carries well, and feels solid enough that I'd assume I could stand on it.",4.0
"I own an American Dimension Deluxe by Fender and the ESP Rocco Prestia's signature 5 string bass, but this Schecter blows them both away in sound and structure. 18 volt, coil taps, neck through the body, Grover tuners and a fat bridge.

"Very sturdy and well built. I plan to put 4 lights on it - 2 ADJ Stingers and 2 ADJ UV Bar 50 IR, and pretty confident this would easily take the weight. The bar stretches a good 10 feet and more, but 10 feet is good enough for me. For the price, this is a great buy. Would recommend.",5.0

"First of all, since version 1.4 of the firmware, this is a 16 voice synth. The synthesis engine is designed by Waldorf, and has a very Blofeld-like character, but without the fiddly matrix style editing. While it's not as powerful, it's perhaps a bit easier to coax great sounding timbres out of it owing to the large, inviting control surface.

Big pads and brass sounds are of course easy to get, you can do this with a single oscillator and fatten it up with the built in chorus. But beyond that, you also have wavetables (100 total) which adds a layer of digital flair and depth to the sound. On top of that you can get really wild by frequency modulating oscillators 1 > 2 and 2 > 3.

Studiologic definitely made some unusual design choices with this synth however. First, aftertouch always follows whatever you have the modulation wheel set to. I would have liked to be able to configure this separately. Second, there is no freely assignable envelope, and the filter envelope can't be routed via the limited modulation matrix. However both LFOs have a ""Ramp"" waveform which really is more like a very basic envelope with speed and depth controlling the attack/decay. Third, there is no LFO sync which can get messy if you're using LFO on a polyphonic sound. I would have liked to see a sync option as well as a retrigger option so that each key press could reset the LFO wave cycle.

Overall though, it's a pretty interesting synth which is definitely unique, not just because of it's school bus yellow color and the fact that the I/O is strangely located on the left hand side of the synth. It definitely left more of an impression on me than the Nord stuff if only due to it's wider range of oscillator options.

Pros: Big keyboard, good if you like synth action. Excellent control surface, wide tonal range.
Cons: Terrible documentation, no LFO sync, monotimbral, etc.

Sledge's 2.0 operating system is due out soon which will add 60mb of sample import (most likely using Waldorf's ""Spectre"" software) and though the demo was in Italian I'm pretty sure I heard mention of splits and layers which would be terrific!",4.0
"The Novation LK25 is nice. I mainly wanted the keyboard and it is great and has decent velocity. The key press is nice and not difficult and springy but not to springy.

I dislike the steps to get the INCONTROL to work but it works if you follow ""the right"" instructions. Definitely not good for the pads themselves. They're not very sensitive and take a strong press to use them. The velocity on them is not ranging well either. Press it lightly no sound. With medium press you get hardly any sound.",4.0

"5 star quality, 1 star for no measurements. I ordered 3 different sets of nut/saddles to get the right size for my Epiphone zr1 acoustic which has a longer saddle than my other guitars; about 3.5"" saddle vs the 3"" of the others.

For those that need the dumbed down version, they work great for slap echo and sound reflections.

They come with there on double side tape which works well, but I would still mount them with something that might be more sturdy. We used double side tape first then once the room was done we mounted them with the appropriate adhesive. On that note our studio stays at a consistent temp. of 68-70 degrees.",5.0

Weighted keys makes this keyboard feel like a real piano. My 5 hear old can play on it like a real piano no problem.

"This is an amazing deal for those who want to start recording music. It comes with a decent recording program for mac/pc as well. The only problem i had was that the headphones are huge, and don't keep other sounds out well.

"These speakers are ok, nothing special. Pretty easy to install, but think the design of it isn't as well thought out.

If you plan to use it outside, you really don't want to hang it vertically, you'd hang it horizontally, and you'd have to tilt it downward.  This would prevent the rain from getting blown into the hole.  In doing so, the knobs that you use to tighten the brackets to the side sometimes slips, so you can't always get it as tight as you want it to be.  Which then makes the speaker gradually slip down completly.

As far as the speakers themselves. I have a Denon AVR-X2200W pushing the speakers (which is a $700 speaker system, so not a cheapy) that pushes them.  However, you really have to crank up the unit for the speakers to get any real volume.  So, I'm not too happy with the speakers. However, they get the job done.  Just wanted something to play some music outside, while I'm out in the yard, but didn't want to get anything crazy where I'd be bothering my neighbors.

So, if I were to do it again, I think I'd get something a bit smaller where I could get the same results.",3.0

I do not get any extra buzzing or humming from my guitars while using this mixer, which is fantastic.

"I set this unit up in a very low budget yet professional setup. Has hundreds of features.  Every input has its own separate output for preview. In the setup that I helped build, we bought 8 7"" screens that were meant for a car headrest for 100 bucks a piece, and we had two 10"" screens for the main preview out and a main output.  The PC input is great for overlays, use a solid color background on a power point slide and chroma key it out, it gives you an excellent sports score overlay, or even a news banner. reverse the chroma key to a green screen on camera and have an animated weather background on the PC and you have a professional weather broadcast. We also used our setup to broadcast football and basketball games, with a 4 and 6 camera setup. Two other inputs were the PC for score overlay, and one that came from an instant replay unit, so that we could do instant replay. The setup we had is probably one of the best run high school productions in our area.  I don't think that there is a thing that you cannot do with this video switcher.",5.0

"I recently started using very light guage carbon strings (E1 is .024 inches) and E1 and B needed double knots (triple knots on E1)  to keep them tied and tuned.  Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.",5.0

"I had been stepping on my guitar chords and it was reaping out of the guitar socket. Not good! This had been going on for a long time. In fact I think I ruin one of my guitars that way. @##$$!.

Then I had a revelation and a challenge to find a wireless guitar hookup. Question was, are there any good wireless guitar systems out there? I did some research and read many reviews. The cheaper ones were too inconsistent. Badly made. Had interference. Affected the quality of the guitar sound.

Then I found the Line 6 Relay G50 wireless system. I was very impressed. It sounded great! The quality was just as good if not better. I am not a very technical guy, so there is no way for me to measure the differences. I could only depend on my good hearing. The sound was very acceptable to great. It depends on which effects you use. I generally play a ""clean"" guitar sound. I only use distortion very rarely. That is not my type of music.

I was skeptical of the product. There were some mixed reviews, but for me it has been great. I like the ""free"" feeling of not being physical or emotional tied to the amp space with its chord limitations. I feel more comfortable and less worried about stepping on wires. As a result its one less thing for me to worry about when I am recording or at a gig.

I was also surprise of the distance it provides. I can be at about 50-75 feet away and it still has a strong signal. I think the promo for this product mentions 200 feet, but I will never be that far. The other thing is if you don't have ear plug monitoring, you can not hear yourself from that far anyway.

Just to be clear here. I used this product with a Line 6 Jam amp 75 watts. A Taylor T5z classic guitar. I also use two EV-1000 watt PA system, mixed through a Yamaha 10 channel mixer.  Your sound may vary but it will work just as good.

Now for the negatives. There are absolutely no instructions on the setup. You figure it out. Bah!. It simple to those who know, but again nothing on the connections. 1. Plug G50 transmitter on to guitar. Plug guitar chord from base ""main out""  unit to amp or to in to stomp box"" 2. Second chord from stomp box to out line to amp. Again easy but no instructions what so ever. To avoid noise or large feedback lower all volume controls until unit lights up and increase slowly. Initially there was a hum but that was an ""Aux"" plug from my Zoom recorder that needed to be removed from the amp.

Other than that unit works flawlessly, No hums, no interference even though I only use channel 1, the unit has 12 channels to choose from.
The base receiver unit is small enough to sit on a amp or PA cabinet. It has two folding antennas. Easy to store. You will need an electrical plug for power on the receiver device. The pocket transmitter is sturdy and durable. It has a small display which indicates power is on and shows channel selection, as well as battery life,which is expressed in minutes. The transmitter requires two AA batteries.  The batteries don't last very long.
Always carry extra AA batteries. I am going to guess that the batteries life on the transmitter will last about 6 hours the most. Don't ever depend on your host to provide any help. And always install fresh batteries when you go on a gig. You won't be sorry. It has never happen to me, but there is
always a first time.

Cons: No instructions included, not even online. Transmitter battery life is limited. Transmitter pack is a bit heavy. Secure the transmitter body pack to the guitar strap, or purchase a case. I like to attach the transmitter to my 2.5 inch, leather guitar strap. I can then check the power on and also mute it if I have to.

"NOTE - I bought these headphones from Status Audio direct during the Black Friday sale and received them a couple days ago, hence why this is not a verified purchase.
These are definitely the best closed back headphones I've owned to date [you can just my head-fi username conquerator2 for a complete list of gear that I've owned and tried]. They are a bit V shaped, with a deep punchy bass response and a broader 5.5 - 7K treble rise but they aren't nearly as recessed in the midrange as most V shaped headphones. On the contrary, these headphones are surprisingly detailed, with very good soundstage and imaging and a surprisingly open sound, without hints of a closed-in feel, which closed back headphones usually have. They are pretty comfy too [great pads] and the build quality is surprisingly decent! You can use any slim profile 3.5mm or 1/8' cable with these; I wasn't a big fan of the tangly straight or coiled cables that were included, so I use a nuforce cable. In conclusion, I am fairly impressed at what these headphones can achieve, considering the price. I enjoy listening to music on them and they can be a good commute headphone too, and why I wouldn't say they'd be my first pick if I were looking for a completely flat monitoring headphone [open headphones usually have an edge here], these will find a permanent staple in my productions as a great closed back for testing aspects like soundstage, bass and highs. These absolutely trounce Beats and would be my current recommendation in this price range.",5.0

"I purchased this unit specifically for my home recording studio.  Although the unit would be quite capable of handling live performances, you would need to add on some type of amp or powered speaker/monitor, or go direct into the front of house mixing board.  Additionally it would really need one of the Line 6 pedal boards in order to functionally handle turning effects on and off as well as selecting different setups in a live situation.  For the purposes of this review I'll only discuss it's usefulness in a recording environment.

First let me say if you are new to the concept of amp modeling be prepared to spend a significant amount of time understanding not only how this unit works, but the basic workflow and principles behind developing and using presets.  I've had several years working with modeling both in the studio and in live performances so I was able to get up and running effectively creating and modifying presets for my needs.  If you're new to be prepared for a significant learning curve before you feel completely comfortable and productive with this unit.  If you're a technophobe this probably isn't the right product for you.

There are several more expensive competive products, but I'm not sure you'd get enough value out of them to justify the additional cost.  This unit comes with a very wide variety of classic and vintage amps and effects as well as special tweaks you can use to adjust the overall sound of your preset.  Not only can you select the amp, but also the cabinet used, the microphone used to record it, and the placement of the microphone.  In addition there are some fairly deep amp parameters dealing with things like bias and sag of the amp you can adjust.  And that's just the amplifier.  Additionally you have a significant range of effects you can add into the signal path like modulations, pitch and harmony, distortion, compressors, etc.  Way more than most people would ever concieve of needing.  Multiply that with the ability to create additional signal paths which allows, for example, the ability to combine two amps into a signal chain and you can begin to understand the range of abilities this unit provides.

All the complexity aside, Line 6 does a decent job of providing a fairly decent range of factory presets you can use right out of the box to get productive with the unit immediately.  Naturally there are many factory presets that are way to bizarre for any uses I might have, but any and all presets can be replaced by those of you own invention, or ones you might download for the user sight where other folks have uploaded their own creations.

Hooking it up was very straightforward.  I already owned a MOTU audio interface so I simply plugged in the XLR cable from one of the outputs into my existing ports on the MOTU and I was ready to record into my home studio software.  The unit does have the capability of operating as an audio interface via a USB connection, but I haven't used that capability as I don't need it.  However the USB connection is still useful in running the computer based editing and control tool for the unit which is much easier to navigate and work with than the buttons and dials on the front of the unit.  One thoughtful feature is the unit has both a microphone and guitar input on the front, so it makes it simple to hook up either or both without having to dig around in the back of the unit.

For my uses I have two powered monitors connected to my audio interface so I can work on developing and testing presets very easily and with good monitors you'll get a very accurate representation of your preset and the changes you make.  If you're doing it this way I'll highly advise you keep the master volume fairly low because some of the overdriven presets could potentially blow out the speakers on a studio monitor if you're not careful.

Overall I'm extremely pleased with the capabilities and ease this unit provides in my recording studio, especially given the price.  I can't imagine any style of music I wouldn't be able to address with this unit whether it be country, jazz, acoustic, or any form of rock or metal.  It's also great that they've included some bass amp models so I can have the same flexibility with bass tracks on my recordings.

The only reason I didn't give this unit 5 stars is Line 6 documentation is horrifyingly bad.  But they do provide some online teaching videos which can help out with this.  My biggest issue is with their arcane and poorly executed software for license management and device updates.  I think they should probably fire the 7th grader they had developing this stuff and hire an experienced programmer who understands professional software development and testing standards.  As far as I can tell they provide no overall guide on how all of this works so you have to stumble your way through it trying to decipher and understand what their popup message boxes are telling you what to do or what's going on during the process and what actions you need to take.  At one point it got so bad my unit got completely stuck in an updating the flash devices mode.  I couldn't even clear it by power cycling the unit.  I was ready to sent the unit back when I tried it one more time and carefully read each popup dialog box to understand what they wanted me to do and got it working again.  VERY frustrating.",4.0

"1 - Buy!

3 - Play.

Quality engineering.  Quality craftsmanship.  Yamaha quality.  I got this as my second acoustic guitar.  My first one being the FG700s, its younger sibling at $100 less.  I wanted a second guitar, and for another $100, you get a dressed up FG700S.  That's pretty much what the FG730s is.  This is absolutely not a beginner guitar.  Out of the box, this guitar is more so an intermediate level guitar.  It comes with plastic nuts, saddle, bridge pins, and alright quality strings.  After a lot more research and how to videos, I swapped out the nuts, saddle, bridge pins for tusq.  Tusq is my prefer material, but bone will work also.  I also swapped out the strings for Elixir strings.  This will rival guitars at $4k range.  The only reason it is not put into the same league as really high end/priced guitar is because this isn't a full solid wood guitar and/or it's not using exotic wood such as KOA, or Ovangkol.  For full solid wood guitars, look at Yamaha top end guitars, the LL series.

Finally I installed the K&K mini pick up system very recently.  A complete and amazing guitar!  I don't even care about those expensive brands any more because they are just overpriced.  There's absolutely no reason to buy them, the extra cost is just you paying for the brand name.  After all the upgrades, I went to guitar center and did A, B between this and much more expensive Taylors and Martin, absolutely blows all these brands out of the water.

PS.  If this is your first guitar, I highly recommend swapping out for Elixir strings.  If you can, go with the lightest string.  This will help make your fingers hurt much much less; allowing you to enjoy the guitar, and practice longer.  The change from the default string to Elixir extra light strings was night and day for me.",5.0

For the money this is a great versatile amp. I have been playing for 5 months and enjoy attempting(lol) all kinds of songs. It really helps motivate you because at least the sound is close to what you're expecting while you're playing. I had an amp with a Boss ME-70 and had a hard time getting it to sound like the song I was trying to play. The presets on this get you in the ballpark. The one negative is that if you are going for a certain sound it doesn't really hit it the same way an amp and a stompbox do. For example when I play Metallica songs I bust out my Peavey amp and my Metal Zone pedal and it hit's harder than even the insane level on the Line 6.,5.0

They clean up like new quickly & easily with just some rubbing alcohol and your finger. Let them dry sticky-side up for about 20 minutes and they're as sticky as the day you bought them.

"This guitar looks nice and sounds good too me. I'm a rookie guitarist, and ""House of the Rising Sun"" is about the only song I can play presently. I bought this guitar because I didn't want to pay a lot of money for something perhaps better, and subsequently lose interest in it.

One reason I bought this classical guitar (as opposed to an acoustic guitar) is because the neck is slightly wider and the strings further apart than on an acoustic guitar. My hands are large, and it makes it easier for me to finger the chords and notes without interfering with other strings. Also, the nylon strings are a little easier on the fingertips then steel strings are. These two guitar types sound differently, and I suppose an expert would buy a guitar based on the type of sound they wanted. I just wanted something cheap and as comfortable as possible for the price. This one worked for me.",5.0

"This is a pretty good pair of headphones but I suggest that you get a amp/dac if you are planning to get this headphone because there isn't enough power to produce the sound that it can potentially produce with an amp/dac. These headphones sound amazing with them an amp/dac but without it, these headphones sound average. The downside to these headphones is the price, sometimes I hear some sort of buzz when I listen to music and stuff, these headphones do leak but if you don't turn up your music up like crazy than leakage isn't that bad, and these headphones are quite heavy but as long as you adjust the headband and wear it a lot, you will get use to it. For 400 dollars I expected something a bit better. These headphones feel more sturdier than the beats and bose headphones. It even comes with an extra set of cables and earpad which the bose and beats don't do. It also, comes with a 2 year warranty from the manufacture which is extremely good especially when bose and beats doesn't do that at all. Bottom line these headphones are average and for 400 dollars these aren't really worth the money but way better built that the more well know companies.",4.0

"The bridge has a very neat look, but what you do no see on the picture neither in the description is that it is made out of two parts screwed together. The string holding block is attached from below with 3 screws to the bass plate. These screws were not properly tensioned and it looks like the screw material is of low quality. I wounder if they might get loose over time and will use locktight on them. I imagine if the bridge would have been machined out of one solid piece the sonic properties would be better. If you use sting through body option it probably does not matter. I bought this bridge because of the higher mass and neater look comparing to the 005-8396-000. Now that I have it in my hands I do not feel its worth the extra 15 bugs.",2.0

"I just received my washboard and just in time. I live off grid and haven't had time to hook my washing machine to the generator. When I run the machine and add water by hand, it takes 32 gallons of water to wash and rinse 1 load. When hauling water and pouring in with five gallon buckets, its a monumental chore. If you don't catch the rinse cycle before it begins, burning up a $500 machine can be hefty.

Off to Lowes I went and bought a 15 gallon galvanized steel tub for $6.00.  I filled it with hot water and soap and baking soda and began to wash my clothes with this wash board. I am amazed at the results!

I moved out to my 40 primitive acres. I am building my dream ranch. I work with swine, goats, chickens, rabbits and ride horses. By the days end, I've earned my sweat and my bath. My bath water is brown. Being a woman, I like things very clean and this wash board so surprised me that Im game for washing my clothes by hand over my machine. The clothes came out spotless, smelling clean and the effort was small compared to what I thought it would be.

The board is well made and perfect size to meet my clothing needs. Excellent product!",5.0

I got it several months ago, after watching a video of a guy playing Concerning Hobbits on a Clarke Sweetone. Now, six months and six whistles later, I still have it and play it occasionally. I do recommend that once you master this one, you should get a fancier, more expensive one (I mostly use my $100 handcrafted one), but for a beginning player, this one works great. It is in an easy key(D), it requires little air, and it sounds just like the one from the Lord of the Rings.",4.0
Good sound!,4.0
"Personally I've been using the Vortex white mk1. Generally I think it's a very effective midi controller, especially for Ableton, that could be built better. Let me elaborate.

The Pros: 37 keys is perfect for keytars, using the pitch bend with your thumb is very natural leaving the touch strip open for modulating parameters, the neck layout is very ergonomic and intuitive, three assignable knobs, one assignable fader, 8 trigger pads, super light, super cheap, built in light show

The Cons: cheap build quality (what'd you expect?), prone to breaking from normal use, accelerometer is wonky, using the touch strip for pitch bend is also wonky, pads need to be hit much to hard to trigger, pad velocity way off

The Lowdown: I got a keytar because I love to put on a performance. The Vortex ended up shaping my playing style. Most of the time I'm using it I'm playing a simple sawtooth monosynth preset. The ribbon controls lowpass filter frequency while one knob controls resonance and the other blends in a sub oscillator. One knob is the same as the touch strip (filter frequency) The fader controls a master reverb cuz I'm into that shoegaze stuff. The fader sticks if you push on it wrong. I don't ever tweak the filter envelope on that preset because I've become really good at articulating the filter with the touch strip. Using my thumb on the pitch bend came very natural and now I'm way too use to it. I use the pads to trigger samples and every patch just changes the section of Ableton's drum rack it plays. You can't really play finger drumming style on the pads because you have to hit them REALLY hard, so I just push them in. I've had two Votrex's break because of normal use but InMusic is good with replacing them as long as they're in stock and you pay to ship the broken one to them. Now I always hold on to an extra in case I have to ship a broken one back. For $99 for the white mk1, I can afford that.

I would change the shape of the vortex to tilt up a bit so you don't have to tilt it up with your leg. Hanging the way it does, it's a bit hard to play articulately, especially because it's so light and it moves around a lot on your body.  If I wanted a better keytar controller I would have to build one myself.  3 stars overall because of the lousy build quality.",3.0

The pedal may be large in size, being the absolute largest pedal on my board, but its a must have for my setup.  It also quiets the hiss of the noisier effect pedals.  Simple to master in seconds.  Heel down reduces volume, toe forward raises volume, knob controls overall master volume.  A great pedal to own.",5.0

"Almost the worst 500 bucks I ever spent. I'm just thanking God I didn't buy it earlier at a higher price.
This is a good recording machine, until you realize you can't record 32 tracks. If you want Tascam quality recording on a lot less tracks and don't care about anything else, go for this. But don't expect to control any sound parameters or effects in the middle of recording. Or mixing, or mastering because you can't.
And this is definitely NOT a mixing or mastering console. I am SOOOO disappointed with every final project I've done so far.
If you are looking for a machine to take your songs Start-To-Finish this is not it.
- There is no midi port, either in or out so you cannot synch with anything.
- There is no way to burn CD.
- There is no control of any aspect of sound while recording. Or mixing. Or mastering. You set the controls and that's where they stay. Unless you want to double-record your part, re-do the effects on the second part and then blend them later, if you can figure out how to assign the effects. And forget the ""guitar"" effects. They suck.
- There are stereo outs, but no ins.
- There are effects outs but no ins
- ONLY USE THIS UNIT WITH A COMPUTER THAT CAN DO THE ACTUAL MIXING AND MASTERING WORK. THIS MACHINE IS AN ADD-ON, NOT A TRUE ""PORTASTUDIO.""

I will NOT recommend this unit. There are equally good recorders for a quarter of the price, and this machine offers nothing else.",2.0

"After having used Cakewalk, Sonar and ProTools, I was ready for a change when I bought my mac mini from Amazon. After reading that Coldplay, Bjork and Radiohead (to name a few) swear by Apple Logic, and seeing that I can master in Dolby Surround, I put forth my $500 and got this software. Whereas you open ProTools and are welcomed to NOTHING (always a blank, gray screen), Apple Logic uses a series of professional wizards to load exactly the set up you WANT and NEED. Like most Apple products, the sophisticated software is plug and play and DOES NOT crash. Simply an amazing attribute. It immediately recognised my ancient MobilePre USB card and works flawlessly.

Apple Logic is actually what you secretly hope for in a music production software, it makes you sound like a GENIUS. With just a crummy mouse, I promise that you'll have looped beats busting in your headphones in 10 minutes. The Piano Roll ACTUALLY WORKS. You get an array of effects and more guitar pedals than you can ever afford (this aspect is worth the $500 alone) that have actual virtual analog knobs and switches that actually work like the real thing. You can elongate and shorten vocal tracks and the design of the software contains excellent pitch control that makes your cracked, awful voice sound amazingly polished. A little tweaking and you won't hardly recognise yourself. For training I highly recommend using the free Lynda.com website. In fact, if you are on the fence about this product, simple watch the free Lynda training videos and you'll be sold.

Don't listen to the moody reviews that grumble that Apple Logic is just a pumped up version of Garage Band. That's absurd. They have nothing in common other than both being easy to use.

"I purchased these with the assumption that I was not going to get the quality sound I wanted as opposed to KRK monitors (WAAAY overpriced) for my small studio.  Boy was I wrong!  The sound quality is better than expected to say the least.  They're HEAVY, thus you won't be too worried about knocking them over (like the smaller KRK's or M-Audio Studiophiles I've seen).  Took these over to a friends house for mixdown of video's he's been working on, and adjusted the settings for his video editing hardware and room dynamics.  He then changed his mind after about some 5 hours of video editing.  Not the best, but I'll be putting my money into what I can use rather than a name (KRK, JBL, Tannoy, Genlec are just TOO much. . .even for just one monitor).  And it'se never about what you got, it's what you do with it.

There are going to be reviews bashing them, but when I have audio engineers telling me ""good choice, cuz the KRK's are sometimes WAAY too bassy"", I feel I've done my job and research into finding what I can afford.

Just a quick note. . .do give these ""burn in"" time.  meaning give them some time to run before going all out on those mixes. Similar to tube preamps for guitar heads/cabs. . .burn em in slowly so you can get the full effect later.  I haven't had these long enough, but I can say they are the best part of my studio.",5.0

"I knew I wanted these pedals for a while now, but considering the review above (the one that states the beaters don't fit on an electric kick pad) and the fact that I generally play on a Roland TD-15, I had my doubts. However, after a while of researching, I finally got them and have no problems with them. They have about a four inch spread, so the beaters fit perfectly fine on a standard kick pad. Don't let the negative review stray you away from getting these if you truly want them.

As for the actual aspects of the pedals, I'm sure you already know from most reviews... These pedals are amazing! They're as light as air. They're actually so light, that it really threw me off at first and it will take a while to adapt to them for sure. Also, there are endless adjustment settings that I have yet to play with. These are only my second pair of double bass pedals (next to a low quality SP double pedal) and I got them with the intention of them being my last. I have zero disappointments. They play really smoothly and open up a whole new world of being able to practice at higher speeds.
Love them!

"My cousin bought this together with the Odyssey case for it. Nice rig up. Hook up to the controller was easy: PC headphone out to the controller (input 1), then (unbalanced) output to a single full range monitor (DAS 115) with USB to PC. I installed the Virtual DJ LE that came with the controller, together with the ASIO driver. At first I couldn't get the cue working on the headphones. I read online that on your PC on V-DJ- go to Config at the top, select output to be headphones and speakers, with ASIO driver. I can't remember whether it was Chan 1&2 - Master/Ch 3&4 to Headphones, or the other way around. After I rebooted the pc, with the controller connected to USB and controller switched on, I then started the software. It worked fine after that.

I have little to no prior experience DJ'ing except off an iPad1, but after watching a couple of videos on the controller on youtube, it was fairly easy to learn the controls (without reading the manual - I know I know - RTFM!!) But I was able to be up and running with the controller in a very short space of time. I showed my younger brother a few basics on it, and he went to town on it for about 3 hours straight at a house party at home! My wife and others around were impressed! :S. We didn't attempt to do any beat matching, but you can definitely do it on this quite easily.  Multiple cue points are great to have. Loop functions useful also.

Very tactile feel of all the buttons. Jog wheel feels firm, but sensitive response. song selector very easy to get used to. Crossfader feels a bit too loose for my liking, and your hand can easily nudge it off point. EQ very useful. I even connected a Gemini dual mic wireless receiver to the single mic input and others had a lot of fun on the two microphones too. Mic ducking works really well when required.

I can't compare it to any other setup since I've never played with another setup, but I'm sure this will be great at house parties and small bars/clubs.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I didn't need an additional sound card, and the level and frequency range of the output was excellent for the input to the DAS 115 monitor. Me and my audiohead cousins were impressed at how well the one speaker box sounded - on MONO! Also - you do need to get/buy that small headphone to RCA cord, and in my case, a double RCA cable and RCA to XLR connector for connecting to the speaker.",4.0

"I purchased this unit several weeks ago. This was not my first CD recorder. I purchased the Tascam CD-RW750 several years ago for about $600. The first thing you will find with these recorders is that you will need to buy a lens cleaner. You will get disc
errors from time to time. After burning several hundred hours of disc's, The laser will wear out. You'll know it when disc errors
become common & cleaning doesn't help anymore. The disc drives are the same ones used on computers with some modifications. So just buying a new disc drive won't do you any good. If you are lucky enough to obtain a replacement,
it will set you back about $160 to $230 (if you install it yourself). Most of the time , The part is no longer available by the time you
need the part. The price was right for this new unit. However ,spending another $600 for another several hundred hours is
just crazy. I  liked my RW750 better. The led displays were much easier to read . And I liked the tray loader better myself.
I Feel it is a major waste of money & resources to throw away a unit that only needs a disc driver. Teac customer service lacks too. Just a heads up. These are made so you will have to buy a new unit over & over again. And all brands ( I have read do the same). There are new CD recorders out called the M disc. LG is making them now for computers. The information is
recorded by etching instead of burning. 1000 years longevity . This may put a cramp on the planned obsolescence style !",3.0

"Hi,

I just received this item today! The package was simple, light weight, and superior quality. Kala's ka slng is obviously underrated and has an excellent craftsman ship at the right price. It is an excellent beginner uke with a soprano body and a concert neck.  Kala knows their stuff , and that is why they are so popular. I will never buy a ukulele over $200 because you can get a decent acoustic guitar  at that price.

Overall, the kala slng is the very best beginner uke at the right price. Most/all uke are made in China. Get the kala slng, and the hard case---very fine craftsmanship. You won't regret it.

"1) When you first open these cans play pink noise through them for 2-6hours to burn in the drivers nicely.
2) Remove the ear cushions and speaker foam pads (its every easy).  Rub the speaker cover/pad with your hands. Work them in till they feel much softer.
3)Replace pads back in the headphones.

This allows the trebled to pass through the foam much clearer and speeds up general burn in for these cans.
The sound is very muddy when you get them, but after proper burn in they sound very, very, very smooth!!!!

So, heres the Good: Great natural sounding, very clean and seriously smooth sonic characteristics. Comfort is what you would expect from a remake of the most popular studio cans. Very, very comfortable!!.

Bad: Cable feels a little cheap, but it is replaceable. Requires more than average burn in. Requires a headphone AMP for proper volumes.

Ugly: Nothing ugly for these cans!!!

Probably the BEST headphones for Sub $100. Tested against Shure SRH 440, BoseAE2 (comfort test only lol), Audio Technica M30's.",5.0

"THis is an AMAZING DEAL!! Trust me as an experienced guitar player and amp buyer that this is my best pick for the price..i actually played with my buddies awhile back so i got an idea of what i was dealing with before i bought it but he payed $799.99 at the time..so big price break to start but what gets me is this thing is gig ready and will never be drowned out by the band. It comes set with hundreds of different presets and sounds so you can sound just like ur favorite band or create name and save your own sounds.on top of all that it has loads of drum presets that sound great like real live drums . you can record your own full songs and play every instrument yourself then savevn name them and put them on your computer to share or make cds with all just from the amp. It uses an sd card to save all of your stuff so with amazing clarity sound, hundreds of things to do, you can't go wrong. I have never gotten bored with this amp. It also allows mp3 player hook ups and foot pedals. Great price and FREE SHIPPING!!??! I ordered it sunday night n got it tuesday afternoon with just standard shipping.

"Build quality:  sturdy stamped steel chassis, seems rugged enough.  The same footprint as a stompbox so it's awesome for organizing pedalboards.

Function: A good sounding wah.  Added bonus is the 3 way range selector switch.  Doesn't work too well for a bass low E, but that's true of most wahs that aren't designed for bass.

I am detracting a star because although it features removable feet for pedalboard mounting, there are 4 screw heads protruding from the bottom of the chassis 2-3mm that make mounting it flush basically impossible. I had to come up with a work around to get it on my board. This isn't a huge deal, but I'm sure the chassis could be redesigned for easier pedal board mounting.  Why is it called Japanese Girl?

"I bought mine from a friend who'd bought it a few months ago and never used it. This makes it second-hand to me though, and therefore there's no warrantee. Too bad, because a month after I'd bought it, the middle pad in the first row--this is a pad that in most set-ups you'd use quite a bit -- wouldn't respond to pressure anymore. I corresponded with Dave Kriss at Keith McMille Instruments about this, and he was nice enough and helpful--suggested it might be a stuck sensor that could be unstuck by squeezing opposing sides of the cross-shaped pad. And it worked, so long as I kept squeezing, which means that its essentially still broken. I assume that most musicians who buy a foot-controller are, like me, not inclined to stop in mid-performance to bend over squeeze a defective pad.

There's a little more bad news. Dave Kiss also told me t that the pads can't be repaired -- there's no sending it back for a fix.

So this leaves me in a quandary. They've offered me a modest discount on another Softstep 2, but should I do that or look for another controller? The problem is that there's no other foot-controller out there that gets better reviews that I know of. Haven't decided what I'll do next. Maybe what happened to my controller is unusual, although the fact that Dave knew of a fix suggests that I'm not the only musician who's had the problem.

This is just one more reason why I'm not planning a return visit to this particular planet......",3.0

"Update (March 31, 2018) The adventure continues.  I made one last attempt with this device.  In Windows 10 I removed the ""Behringer USB audio driver 2.8.40"" and allowed Windows 10 to install the ""USB Audio CODEC"" driver.  Buried in the Audacity documentation is a description about accessing the properties of this driver and going thru that I found there is a way to enable 2 Channel recording.  For my Surface Book the built in sound system is from Realtek.  The Audacity doc specifically mentions Realtek as one that has issues with the initial install of the ""USB Audio CODEC"" driver.

So, here is the required magic if you attach the UCA202 to a Surface Book computer.  Before turning on the laptop attach the UCA202 to a USB port.  Start the computer.  In lower right of screen right click the speaker icon and select ""Recording devices"".  In the ""Sound"" dialog right click on the ""USB Audio CODEC Microphone"" and choose properties.  Click on the 'Advanced' tab.  In the drop down box choose ""2 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz."" or whatever 2 channel option you want.  Be sure Audacity is set to the same rate.

I'm raising the rating to three stars since the problem I've encountered might be confined to the Realtek sound system.  So far the UCA202 has worked without flaw, its the setup that can be an issue.  It is advertised as plug and play which is not entirely true.  Of course, that's part and parcel for most Windows apps and devices.

Update (March 30, 2018) - I'm not having much success with the UCA202 using the ""Behringer USB audio driver 2.8.40"".  With it I am at least recording both input channels of the UCA202 but Windows 10 (most recent version) running on a Surface Book is no longer stable.  I'm using Audacity as the sound processor and have selected the ""Inline Behringer"" input set to stereo but the computer completely freezes after about 45 minutes of recording.  CTRL-ALT-DELETE is not available and I have to force a power shutdown.  Searching the internet yields many places with this driver.  None of those places are associated with Behringer so maybe can't be trusted.  The driver supplied on the Behringer web site does not work.  The driver installed by Windows 10 does not cause Windows to crash but then only the left channel of the UCA202 delivers a signal so it essentially does not work either.

I suspect the issue is that the ""Behringer USB audio driver 2.8.40"" driver derives from the Windows 7 and Vista days and is probably not compatible with Windows 10.

My situation might be unique, not the first time, but it is frustrating that the unit does not work ""hassel free"" as advertised and that the vendor is not supplying a driver that works in Windows 10.

So - I'm returning the unit.

(Entry on March 29, 2018)
Working now.  I returned it once thinking the right channel of the input was no longer working.  Turns out I did not have the correct driver installed to Windows 10.  There are many Amazon reviews that indicate it is plug & Play, and the Behringer advertising indicates the same, but not in Windows 10.  Windows 10 does install a USB driver but not one which works with the UCA202.  You have to install the ""Behringer USB audio driver 2.8.40"" driver.  The Behringer web site DOES NOT supply the driver and it is not included with the UCA202.  But there are many sites that do provide both a 32 and 64 bit version of the driver.  The user manual does not describe the need to install a device driver.  I'm giving the UCA202 a two star rating due to poor documentation and misleading advertising.",3.0

"These earplugs were entirely unusable for me.  When removing, the tip would disconnect from the rest of the plug, leaving me to fish out the tip.  This seems like a poor design, as this can lead to complications, especially if the tip becomes lodged deeper in the ear canal.

I tested these during band practice and they did filter out noise decently while in place, but they fell out of place with too much movement.  For reference, earplugs that I use are typically sized between a small and a medium.

I do like the aesthetic of these (compared to earplugs that attempt to be either clear or skin-toned), but otherwise these do not have any advantage over a comparable set of Downbeats, Earpeace or Earasers (all of which I have used).",1.0

"I was trying to give this board 4.5 stars, but I had to go with 4 because it wasn't quite a 5.

I've been playing piano for 25 years, I've owned a Motif 8, Motif XS6, Roland Fantom G8, Roland Fantom X6, and many other boards. My most recent was an AKAI MPK88, which I used solely for my sample libraries. But I was looking for something that I could use in live situations without having to lug around my laptop and peripherals.

I saw this keyboard at GC and thought, ""Why not?"" Roland has a good reputation for quality gear. Now whenever I look for a keyboard, it has to have the big three in order to satisfy my personal needs; pianos (acoustic and electric), organ, and synth. Any other sounds are just fluff to me (although some of their other stuff sounds pretty good).

Right off the bat, I thought the pianos sounded very good--not as great as my Ravenscroft 275 sample library I use in the studio, but I've always had different expectations of ""live sound"" instruments vs ""studio sound"" instruments. The pianos are very present, detailed, and just the right frequency in the lower and higher register, though they can still be EQd in the global control menu.

The keys felt amazing---even though they're older technology than what's available on the market. What I loved about them compared to my MPK88 and other boards is that they are quiet! I do reviews of sample libraries on my youtube channel HIFIMIDI, and I always have to mute my mic because the keys were loud. But not on the FA08. They're quiet, they feel smooth and perfectly weighted for my needs, and they don't hurt my hands when I play a sweep. I do wish they had triple sensors, though. But you'd have to pay $1,000 more for that. The EPs were okay. I wish the tremolo on them was more realistic, but it sounds too digital.

The organs were mediocre--and consequently my least favorite of the ""big three."" The leslie simulator sounds digital and was not customizable enough. Yamaha does better in this regard.

The synth section was great. I use a lot of pad sounds and the glass and organ pads added that ethereal, moving sound I wanted.

The board is light-weight, which I love. It makes it easy loading and unloading it. I don't like that it is black against red, though. It makes it hard to see in the dark. The LED display is pretty nice, though. It makes the keyboard look very modern. The entire board is beautiful and sleek to me, however.

All in all, it's easy to edit and layer sounds, which is what I'm mostly using it for. It also works well with my DAW (Pro Tools 12 and Logic Pro X) after installing the driver, although not so in-depth in Pro Tools.

This keyboard is basically, a Roland Integra and the A88 combined with some better features. Those would cost you $2500, so this is a good money saving option. After buying it, I spent a couple of hours just messing with the sounds and feeling pretty happy with my purchase--mostly because it didn't cost a whole lot for what it gives.",4.0

"The Sennheiser HD 800 headphones are Sennheiser&apos;s flagship cans and really offer all the best qualities that come from over 60 years of sound engineering.

Unlike other headphones, such as the Beyerdynamic Tesla T1, HiFiMAN HE-6, etc., which base their headphones off of a previous model, e.g. DT 880, HE-5, the HD 800s are based on a completely different driver and housing design. The construction is very high-quality, and utilizes TRS plugs for the headphone cable, enabling easy upgrades from their stock cable (albeit, it is still very high-quality).

You definitely need to have an amplifier to power these properly due to their extremely high impedance (600 ohms). With the right amp, the &apos;bright&apos; quality that listeners tend to criticize Sennheiser for, disappears, leaving a rich, crisp bass signature.

The HD 800s also have fairly good resale value -- typically going for around $1,000+ in good condition. Potential owners need to be somewhat careful with these cans as they&apos;re prone to paint chipping, and I would not recommend them for portable use as they have a semi-open design, resulting in a fair amount of sound leakage.

Overall, unless you are going for a full Stax rig or want to pay thousands for out-of-production headphones like the Audio-Technica L3000, these are the best cans out. If you want something that is more balanced and can be used primarily for portable use, the Ultrasone Edition 8 or Signature Pros are probably your best bet. I spent the last few years acquiring and testing numerous headphones both open and closed, and can say confidently that these are my favorite, both in terms of listening pleasure and overall clarity and sound quality.",5.0

Otherwise the instrument will be on one side, and the vocals on the other during playback, (during recording, the headset monitoring ""from the mic"" is in stereo which of course you need).  Even if you're just using the mic, you still have to tie the track to a stereo bus as it only comes through on the left.  You also have to crank the mic gain up pretty high to achieve good recording levels for voice/vocals which can lead to some noise depending on your set-up, soundcard,and power quality.  So a nice USB pre-amp to go with this mic might be a big plus again depending on your set-up.  I've been very happy with this mic without a pre-amp, and I'm fairly certain you would be too.

P.S. This is a VERY sensitive, supercardioid mic!  The SP04 shock mount is a must!!!  A pop filter is HIGHLY recommended, and depending on the room...you may even want to use a wind screen to avoid air movement rumble.",5.0

"I guess you can't complain about owning one of the finest guitars ever created.

I too, have owned this guitar for about a year and a half.

Upon the first strum I knew that my overly-expensive Takamine Santa Fe was going on eBay immediately.
The tone is astounding compared to most other guitars.
Nice evenly balanced warmth and clarity.
You can ""bang one out"" or delicately pick & strum a tender melody or tune.

The included Fishman pickup system that I received with mine is different from the other review.
There is not a built-in tuner on my model.
Gibson frequently experiments with various different on-board electronics and uses different formats even on the same guitars.

The Fishman Electronic Pickup System on my SDLX is not implanted inside a routed-out hole in the body of this beautiful instrument, rather, they installed a system that is mounted directed above the inside soundhole. You can adjust the settings with your fingertip.
There is a good side and a bad side.

First the good side:
This allows for your guitar to NOT have a hole in the body and possibly create more resonance. I like this. It also has a ""modeling feature"" that mimics the settings of a studio mic'd guitar. I think this is cool but have found to like the ""straight pickup"" setting which does not alter tone using modeling circuits...just straight pickup.

The bad side:
There is no built-in tuner.
You cannot pop in a soundhole damper plug/ring to help reduce feedback because the ""hardware"" that is mounted inside the soundhole prevents a damper from fitting snug.
The battery is mounted inside the guitar, in a little Velcro bag and makes changing it a cumbersome task unless you happen to be changing all the strings at once, which I rarely due, so I look forward to having ""string marks"" dug into the back of my hand when I do change the battery.

One weird thing happened:
When it arrived there was an obvious inconsistency on the higher strings. The sound would ""drop out"" and was noticeably lower in volume.
When I called Gibson (and they answered immediately) I was told to get a ""spark plug socket"" and a screwdriver. Place the edge of the socket on the bridge and ""sharply tap"" it down making sure it was well-seated. I was shocked and scared being asked to whack on my several thousand dollar guitar, but the guy stayed with me on the phone and walked me through it...WHALLAH! - The sound was perfect and I couldn't be happier.

The inlays, appointments, wood binding is just gaudy enough to be cool and not overdone. It has a dark mystique to it and I love the extra detailing and craftsmanship. After a lifetime of playing music full-time I definitely deserve this guitar. That was the only criteria in my justification. You only live once and this guitar is a dream-come-true for me.

The neck is just wide enough to do some nice fingerstyle playing without muting or dampening adjacent strings which is easy to do with guitars that initially seem easier to play with their skinny necks, but find out later down the road that you will actually need the width to accomplish certain riffs, picking and chording.
Once my hand got away from the Takamine trip and used to the slightly wider Gibson neck, I found myself playing much cleaner and more articulate...and sounding ten times better.

Yes the Takamine sounds nice when plugged into an amp, same as the Gibson, but when you hear them unplugged, purely acoustic side-by-side there is absolutely nothing to compare beyond that point. The expensive Takamine sounds like a cheap toy compared to the warmth, big tone and volume of the Songwriter Deluxe. The same situation occurs when compared to the Sigma Cutaway acoustic....just sounds like cheap junk when put side-by-side. I highly urge you to do this when purchasing a guitar. Just because your favorite artist plays ""X Brand"" - doesn't mean that guitar is the best, most desirable, or even right for you.

Disclosure: I have been ""married"" to Gibson for over 30 years -lol.
I knew that I wanted a Gibson. I believe in the company even though they are becoming more compromising as the years roll on.
Yes, the Custom Shop ""ain't what it used to be"" and Yes, you MUST have your guitar professionally setup to suit your style and needs. If not you may not be getting the most out of your professional expensive guitar.

The action is lower than most from the factory, but you may find it a little high or a little low depending on what you like or are accustomed to. This is a given with all guitars. They crank them out at the factory, and you tweak them in at the shop. Everybody has different likes & needs when it comes to their personal setup and tastes. The higher the strings, the louder and more breathable it is, the lower the action, the easier to play but may seem more ""compressed"" and weaker in volume. It's all a ""trade-off"" and you have to decide where to demarcate the balance. Sometimes I wish my action was a little higher, then other times I am so glad it's not!

I also did some research on a killer acoustic guitar amp.
My conclusion, for the money PLUS under one thousand dollars price tag, goes to the SWR California Blonde II amp.
It has plenty of power and many great tone features. I couldn't be happier, and when playing live I use a very slight amount of compression (Boss Compressor Pedal) and it smooths everything out perfectly without sacrificing tone or dynamics...in other words, Yes, it makes me sound like I can play better than I actually do! A compressor will even out the volume and dynamics so that strings & notes that are weak are brought out, and ones that are way too dominant can be tamed a bit.

A full-sized professional guitar with all the bells and whistles any great craftsman would be proud to build complete with a Gibson Custom Shop logo!

The photo does not show but there is a fantastic inlay seam running down the length on the back side of the guitar made of gold, red and jade green using a southwest motif.

There is a nice wood bound seam at the end of the guitar bottom. (where you plug in and attach strap.)

There is NOT a strap button on the neck or neck butt joint. You will need to tie a strap to the headstock or install a strap button, and I would ask Gibson where they suggest and how before doing anything irreversible.

I am glad they didn't use the ""Mustache type"" saddle bridge, I like the traditional one much better!

One more note:
The newer models no longer use the ebony fingerboard. They are using the rosewood. I think this is probably for the best as it seems to be a little warmer than the hard snap of an ebony fingerboard. This guitar is bright and ringy as well as warm and full. Not too much bass overtones dominating the overall tone, but a well-balanced expression and three times as loud compared to most Takamine's and other imports.

Buy this guitar if it is still being made!
(You deserve it and remember: You only live once!)

"Hello! I owned this unit for 5 months now and it has worked on and off! I'm an electronic's technician and can tell you the quality of this unit is garbage. The first time I charged the unit, it worked beautifully the next day. After that, the problems started. I realized at times the unit would not take a charge. I figured it out. When the unit doesn't take a charge, I put the Ipod in the dock and turn the ""charge ipod"" mode on. For some stupid reason, it's starts to charge. And even if you charge it and not use it for a week, the battery will be dead or close to dead by the time you are trying to use it. The reliability of this unit is very sketchy. I have called their customer service at Pyle at least 10 times and the people who work there apparently barely speak any english!! Great! The first service tech there told me that it was a problem with the battery. If I wanted a battery it would be at least a month. Long story short, I did what they wanted(fax them a proof of purchase) and never heard from them. Then I called them back again and they told me to send the unit. Well damn. My wife threw away my box while cleaning! Would cost me like $40 to ship it to New York from Oakland! Not even worth it. Save yourself the headache and look into a MiPro system or even the Bose portable if you don't need to hook up a mic. I think the MiPro looks much better(though more expensive) than the blockrocker in terms of quality.

Also more problems: at times the unit battery level will start flashing!!! Maybe indicating that the battery is low? But it will flash with 3 of the green lights on! Also sometimes the volume won't go as loud as I would want. I have to smack it on the side and it suddenly gets louder! lol. What a hunk of crap!

I believe the problem remains mostly in the battery of these units. And when I called PYLE for another battery I was told that there are over 100 people waiting for a battery for these units! Also another flaw is that the knobs for the volume and ipod input level are very fragile. Behind the knows is a computer board. If you were to have anything smack against the board, it could(and I've seen it happen) damage the board, as I have repaired and replaced one of these boards before. There should had been built a cover for the knobs.

Lastly, I have at least 5 friends with the ""blockrocker"" system. 4 out of 5 of them had serious problems with theirs. One of my friend took her to a electronic recycling company because it no longer worked, even while plugged into an electric socket. She has 2 other friends that both had their blockrockers die on them. Both ION and PYLE are junk companies(pyle being worse cause they can't hardly understand or speak english) with very poor service as I have delt with both. They have taken my friends' money and mine without backing up their product. I have repaired 2 ION blockrocker systems and they had shipped the wrong part for me 3 times!! And one of my friends paid $300 for his and it was broken in 4 months. I will never recommended a ION or PYLE product ever again in my life!",1.0

"I've been a working musician since 1969 and I've been through a ton of guitars from major brands to pawn shop cheapies...a bit over a year ago I played a Dot Studio owned by a friend and ordered one the next day. After about a month of gigs I bought a second. They are simply great, well balanced with a kick-a$$ sound regardless of what amp I use...the price is a plus, but I won't say it's ""great for the price,"" because the truth is they are great at any price! I have had mild intonation problems with one of them but going to a slightly heavier gage string and a very minor bridge adjustment took care of it. They sound big and fat or dirty and bluesy, they stay in tune, and they are SIMPLE to control. (I am tired of having to fiddle with 5, 6, or more controls to find the sound I want.) The Epiphone Dot Studio is a fantastic guitar! The two I have, along with an electric 12-string, are the only axes I travel with.",5.0
